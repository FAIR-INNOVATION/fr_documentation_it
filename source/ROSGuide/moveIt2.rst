    :align: center

Configuring Virtual Joints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Virtual Joints is the virtual axes of the robot, when the robot is installed on the mobile platform, it is necessary to set the virtual axes for the robot, set the name of the virtual axes, the sub-links, the type of joints, etc.

when the mobile platform moves, the virtual axes will also synchronize with the movement of the robot to drive the robot to move, so as to realize the robot with the movement of the mobile platform function this time the robot will be placed directly on the world coordinate system, named virtual_joints.

.. image:: img/fairino_harware_006.png
    :width: 6in
    :align: center

Configuring Planning Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Planning Groups is the planning group of the robot, which will be the joints that need to be considered in the same kinematic calculation in the same planning group for unified forward and reverse kinematic calculations, such as placing a robot on an AGV cart, and then installing a fixture at the end of the robot, the test will be the four joints of the AGV cart in a planning group, the six joints of the robot in a planning group, and one of the joints of the fixture in a planning group for kinematics calculations.

One joint of the fixture is in one planning group for kinematic calculation. Since this does not involve the fixture so only add the robot's joints group, that is, the arm group, first of all add the arm group, the dynamics solver Kinematic Solver select kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin, and then the default planner Group Default Planner select TRRT, then click Add Joints to add joints for this planning group.

.. image:: img/fairino_harware_007.png

    :align: center

Configuring Robot Poses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Robot Poses is the robot preset poses, which defines some preset poses for each planning group, and a home pose for arm, which can be chosen at will.

.. image:: img/fairino_harware_010.png
    :width: 6in
    :align: center

Robot Poses can define preset poses for each planning group. When there are fixtures in the robot, you can add a fixture planning group in the Planning Groups section, and then set the preset poses for the fixtures when setting poses in Robot Poses.

Configuring End Effectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
End Effectors is the robot end actuator, the planning group of end actuator is hand, and then the default connected parent_link is panda_link8, since there is no end actuator this time, so this step can be skipped.

ros2_control URDF Modifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ros2_control URDF Modifications is mainly used to set the joint data type of sending and feedback, you can choose the position, speed, torque three kinds of joint data type of sending and feedback are position control, and then directly Add interfaces to be able to.

.. image:: img/fairino_harware_011.png
    :width: 6in
    :align: center

.. important:: 

   - Note: 

    Selecting the joint data type needs to match the subsequent fairino_hardware plug-in, and select the joint data type for sending down and feedback according to the data transmitted by the fairino_hardware plug-in. Since the fairino_hardware plug-in controlling the motion of the actual robot this time uses the position data type, this time the Because the fairino_hardware plug-in that controls the motion of the actual robot uses the position data type, this time the joint data type chosen for sending and feedback are both position control.
   

ROS 2 Controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ROS 2 Controllers is mainly used to generate the ros2_controllers.yaml file, which sets the release frequency, joint name, controller name, controller type, etc.

Configure ROS 2 Controllers, configure controllers for each planning group, click Auto Add JointTrajectoryController Controllers For Each Planning Group.

.. image:: img/fairino_harware_012.png
    :width: 6in
    :align: center

Moveit Controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Moveit Controllers is mainly used to generate the moveit_controllers file, which sets the controller name, controller type, etc. It should be noted that the controller name in moveit_controllers needs to be the same as that of ros2_controllers, or it will not run smoothly. It should be noted that the controller name in moveit_controllers should be the same as the controller name in ros2_controllers, otherwise it will not run smoothly.

When the controller name in moveit_controllers is the same as the controller name in ros2_controllers, the controller type in moveit_controllers will be automatically mapped to the controller type in ros2_controllers, realizing that the control data sent down through the moveit_controllers is sent to ros2_controllers, and then the actual robot motion is driven by the plug-in in ros2_controllers.

Fairino_hardware Plugin (custom robot moveit configuration package)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fairino_hardware plugin for the connection between moveit and the robot's intermediate layer, through the fairino_hardware plugin move_group will be sent to moveit_control, and then forwarded to ros2_control, ros2_control and then through the fairino_hardware plugin to drive the actual robot movement, and fairino_hardware plugin will also accept the actual robot feedback data, so as to realize the rviz2 simulation interface robot model and the actual robot synchronization.

Hardware plug-in drives the actual robot motion, and fairino_hardware plug-in also accepts the feedback data from the actual robot, thus realizing the synchronization between the robot model of the rviz2 simulation interface and the actual robot, and thus realizing the function of the user driving the actual robot motion through the rviz2 interface.

And thanks to the implementation of the fairino_hardware plug-in, the Fairino robot can access the ros2_control control framework, making the Fairino robot compatible with third-party packages based on ros2_control.

Fairino_hardware Plugin Compilation

To use the fairino_hardware plug-in, the version of the fairino_hardware plug-in needs to be the same as the version of the Valeo robot. robot motion data sent by ros2_control is converted to a data type acceptable to Fairino robot.

So it is critical that the fairino_hardware plug-in's data type is consistent with the Fairino robot's data type, and the different versions of the plug-in and the robot may result in different data types, so before officially debugging the fairino_hardware plug-in, you need to confirm that the version of Fairino robot is consistent with the version of fairino_hardware plug-in and the version of the robot.

Before debugging the fairino_hardware plugin, you need to make sure that the version of the Fairino robot is the same as the version of the fairino_hardware plugin, and if it is not, you need to upgrade the Fairino robot.

- First of all, you can check the current version of the robot in the “WebAPP Interface->System Settings->About” interface of Fairino Robotics.

- Then you need to prepare the official robot software package, then enter the “WebAPP interface->Auxiliary applications->Robot body->System upgrade” interface of the Fairino Robot, and then click the “Select file” button to select the prepared software package corresponding to the version of the fairino_hardware plug-in, and then select “Upload package” and wait for the software upgrade to complete. Click the “Select File” button, select the robot software upgrade package corresponding to the version of the fairino_hardware plug-in, select “Upload Package”, and wait for the software upgrade to complete.

- After the upgrade is completed, the system will prompt the need to restart the robot, the robot control box switch to the off position, wait for about 25 seconds, and then start the robot, so the robot software version upgrade is complete, you can carry out the subsequent fairino_hardware plug-in compilation and use.

Problems Likely To Be Encountered
---------------------------------------------------
The robot model may not be loaded on the right side of the Configure Robot Feature Pack.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Solution: This error may be due to the path in the .urdf file is not written correctly, can be solved by modifying the path in the .urdf file and copying the meshes file into the workspace under install/test_moveit/share/test_moveit.

After generating the package, there is an error running it.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Solution: Removing line 203 in the launches.py file “default_value=moveit_config.move_group_capabilities["capabilities"],” in ["capabilities"] will fix it.

Summarize
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This tutorial describes the installation, configuration and use of the MoveIt2 plug-in; the installation and use of the fairino_hardware plug-in to realize the synchronous motion of the rviz2 simulation robot and the actual robot; and the compilation and running of the mtc sample code package to realize the customization function with the help of the moveit2 and fairino_hardware plug-ins.

It is hoped that the elaboration of this tutorial will enable users to have a more comprehensive understanding of MoveIt2 and the fairino_hardware plugin, and hopefully help them to better personalize the FAIRINO Robot service features.
