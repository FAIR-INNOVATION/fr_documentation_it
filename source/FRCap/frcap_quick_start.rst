I already have FRCap
----------------------------
If you already have an FRCap project folder and it conforms to the FRCap project structure , please read Build FRCap directly \ `FRCap directly <frcap_quick_start.html#build-frcap>`__\.

If you already have a complete plug-in package with the file extension name ".plugin", please read \ `Hello FRCap <frcap_quick_start.html#hello-frcap>`__\.

Build FRCap
-------------
If you already have a complete plug-in package with the file extension name ".plugin", please read Hello FRCap directly.

Depending on the system you are currently using, first open the build script, modify the buildName parameter to the name you want, then save and close, and execute the corresponding script in the terminal.

- Start the terminal in Windows and run the following commands:
  
.. code-block:: c++
   :linenos:

   ./build.bat

- Start a terminal in Linux and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: c++
   :linenos:

   ./build.sh

After the build is completed, a package file with the file name FRCap and the file suffix ". frcap " is generated in the FRCap project directory.

Hello FRCap

After the FRCap project is built, open a browser on your local computer and enter the robot's default IP address (http://192.168.58.2) and log in to the WebApp, click "System Settings" -> "FRCap Management" -> "Import" . Select the built FRCap package file with the ". frcap " suffix , open it and upload it. After the upload is successful, the imported FRCap information will be displayed in the plug-in information list below.

Use the operation bar in the list to control whether FRCap is enabled and deleted, and check the enablement status of FRCap in the start/stop status bar.

After Hello FRCap is enabled, it can be used in "Auxiliary Applications"-> "FRCap" -> "Hello FRCap". This page carries the configuration class FRCap , which can be full-width or half-width. By default, it is displayed in half-width.
