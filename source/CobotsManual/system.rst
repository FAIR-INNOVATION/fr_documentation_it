- **Set network card**: Enter the network card IP, subnet mask (linked with IP, automatically filled in), default gateway, and DNS server that need to communicate. The factory default IP of network card 0 network port is: 192.168.57.2, and the factory default IP of network card 1 network port is: 192.168.58.2.

- **Teach pendant enable**: Control whether to enable the teach pendant. The teach pendant is turned off by default, and the device cannot be operated using the teach pendant. Click the slide switch button to enable the teach pendant to operate the device.

- **Access IP**: Select the network card associated with WebAPP and WebRecovery. When the teach pendant is enabled, WebAPP selects network card 1 by default, and network card 0 is not selectable.

- **Set up network**: Click the "Set up network" button, and it will prompt that the configuration is in progress. After the configuration is complete, you need to restart the device.

Robot Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::
   1. The robot model configured here is a custom robot model name, which is inconsistent with the robot model function configured in "System" -> "Maintenance" -> "Controller Compatible";
   2. It is not recommended to use names starting with "FR" and "ART". If you enter a custom robot model starting with "FR" and "ART", the model name you enter must be consistent with the "Model Abbreviation" in the robot model catalog table (for details of the robot model catalog table, see the "Robot Model Configuration" section).

Parameter range configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter range configuration, only the administrator can adjust the parameter range, and the parameters of other authorized members can only be set within the parameter range set by the administrator.

There are two ways to set parameters: slider dragging and manual input. 

.. important:: 
   The maximum value of the parameter range must be greater than the minimum value. 3 seconds after the parameter range is successfully configured, it will automatically jump to the login page, and you need to log in again.
