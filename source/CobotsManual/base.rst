Soft limit
~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the menu bar of "Initial" -> "Base" -> "Joint", click "Soft limit" to enter the soft limit interface.

There may be other equipment in the robot's stroke, and the limit angle can softly limit the robot so that the robot's movement does not exceed a certain coordinate value and prevent the robot from colliding. Triggering the soft limit to stop the robot is automatically triggered by the robot, and there is no stopping distance.

Administrators can use the default values or enter angle values. Input the angle value to limit the positive and negative angles of the robot joints respectively. When the input value exceeds the robot joint soft limit angle value listed in the robot basic parameter table in 2.1-Basic Parameters, the limit angle will be adjusted to the maximum value that can be set. When the robot reports that the command exceeds the limit, it needs to enter the drag mode and drag the robot joints to within the limit angle. The interface is shown in figure below.

Joint Soft Limit Protection
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
************************

The Joint Soft Limit Protection function is an active safety mechanism that dynamically restricts operators from exceeding the set soft limit range during drag teaching by real-time monitoring of the robotic arm's joint motion status. This feature ensures soft limits remain effective during drag teaching, thereby enhancing human-robot collaboration safety.

Joint Soft Limit Protection
********************************

The Joint Soft Limit Protection function requires matching software package and firmware versions for optimal performance.

Soft Limit Configuration and Function Control
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Step1**: Log in to the web interface, navigate to "Initial Setup"->"Basic"->"Joints"->"Soft Limits" to access the robot soft limit configuration module.

.. centered:: Figure 6.4‑1-2 Robot Soft Limit Configuration Module

**Step2**: Set appropriate soft limits for each joint based on the robot's actual working range. Verify whether each joint's current angular position is within the preset soft limit range. If yes, click "Apply" to implement the preset soft limits; if not, move each joint within the preset range first. Otherwise, an out-of-limit error will appear when clicking "Apply", as shown below. In this case, perform single-axis jogging or dragging toward the valid range to clear the error.

Collision level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the menu bar of "Initial" -> "Base" -> "Joint", click "Collision Level" to enter the collision level interface.

The collision level is divided into one to ten levels, and the detection of one to three levels is more sensitive, and the robot needs to run at the recommended speed. At the same time, you can choose to customize the percentage setting, and 100% corresponds to the tenth level. The collision strategy can set the processing method of the robot after the collision, which is divided into error stop and continuous movement, and the user can set it according to the specific use requirements. Such as Figure 6.2‑16.

Post-collision response strategy function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the basis of the original collision strategy in motion, " Gravitational moment mode " and " Vibration response mode " are added to ensure the safety of man-machine cooperation. 

When the two strategies are triggered, they will switch from automatic mode or manual mode to drag mode. The Gravitational moment mode will move away from the collision point according to the magnitude and direction of the collision force, while the Vibration response mode will return to the collision position after moving away from the collision point. At the same time, collision detection at rest is added.

Collision strategy
+++++++++++++++++++++

FT_Guard command is used to realize collision detection based on force sensor. The previous collision strategies were "collision stop", "collision pause" and "moving on". In order to avoid the extrusion force between robot and object after collision, the strategies of "Gravitational moment mode", "Vibration response mode" and "Collision rebound mode" are added.

When triggered, all three strategies will switch from automatic mode or manual mode to drag mode, and then switch to manual mode. Among them, the Gravitational moment mode will be far away from the collision point according to the magnitude and direction of the collision force; The Vibration response mode will return to the collision position after being far away from the collision point; The collision rebound mode will accelerate away from the collision point according to the set parameters.

Gravitational moment mode
*****************************

The Gravitational moment mode in collision strategy is set as follows.

**Step1**:Click "Collision Level" under the menu bar of "Initial" -> "Base" -> "Joint" to enter the corresponding interface.

**Step2**:In the column of "Collision Strategy", click the drop-down box to select " Gravitational moment mode ", and the interface is shown below; Then, click the "Apply" button to enable the function. 

.. note:: In the operation of the robot, if the load mass changes greatly, this strategy is not recommended; This strategy is not recommended if the running speed is too fast.

**Step1**:Click "Collision Level" under the menu bar of "Initial" -> "Base" -> "Joint" to enter the corresponding interface.

**Step2**:In the column of "Collision Strategy", click the drop-down box to select " Vibration response mode", and the interface is shown below; Then, click the "Apply" button to enable the function.

.. note:: It is not recommended to use this strategy if the robot runs too fast.

Collision rebound mode
**************************

The collision rebound mode in collision strategy is set as follows.

**Step 1**：Click "Collision Level" under the menu bar of "Robot Settings" in the initial setting to enter the corresponding interface.

**Step 2**：In the column of "Collision Strategy", click the drop-down box to select "Collision Rebound Mode", and set the safety time of 1000ms, the safety distance of 150mm, the safety speed of 150mm/s, and the safety factor of each joint is 5. The specific interface is shown below.

.. image:: base/049.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.4-5 Collision rebound mode of collision strategy

The meaning of each parameter:
  - Safe time: indicates the duration in drag mode after switching from automatic mode to drag mode, and the range is [1000-2000] ms;
  - Safe distance: indicates the position of the robot away from the collision point after collision, and the range is [150-200] mm;
  - Safe speed: indicates the maximum TCP speed of the robot away from the collision point after collision. If the speed limit is exceeded, the rebound force will be restrained, and the range is [50-250] mm/s;
  - Safety factor: indicates the attenuation speed of rebound force. The smaller the factor, the faster the attenuation and the faster the rebound speed, and vice versa. The range is [1-10], dimensionless.

FT_Guard Command
**********************

FT_Guard command is used to realize collision detection of force sensor. First select the direction of detection, or set all directions. Then, the current force sensor data is obtained as the initial value, and then the maximum threshold and minimum threshold are set to determine the upper and lower limits of collision force triggering, so that the collision detection function setting can be completed. Take the Z-direction configuration as an example. See Figure for detailed settings.

The setup steps of static collision detection are as follows.

**Step1**:Click "Collision Level" under the menu bar of "Initial" -> "Base" -> "Joint" to enter the corresponding interface.

**Step2**:Turn on the switch for static collision detection, as shown below. When it is detected that the gap between the joint torque command and the torque feedback is too large, the robot will enter the drag mode to avoid continuous extrusion force.

Torque Detection Function Before Dragging
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
***********************
Before the robot enters the drag mode, torque detection is required. The function of this is to prevent abnormal phenomena such as lifting or falling after the robot enters the drag mode due to the operator setting incorrect load parameters or selecting the wrong installation method. If the joint torque is detected to exceed the allowable range, the controller will immediately report an error and prohibit the robot from entering the drag mode.

Torque Detection Before Dragging
**************************************

**Step1**: Click "Initial Settings"->"Basic"-> "Joints"->"Collision Level" to enter the collision level setting interface, and turn on the torque detection function before dragging, as shown in Figure 2-1.

.. image:: base/069.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.4-9 Torque Detection Function Before Dragging Enabled

**Step2**: Switch to drag mode. The Web interface enters the drag mode by clicking the robot status area - robot drag status, long pressing the teach pendant "Teach Mode" button, or long pressing the robot end drag button. If the controller reports an error and the robot does not switch to drag mode, as shown in Figure 2-2, check whether the robot load configuration and installation method are correct.

.. centered:: Figure 6.4-10 Torque Exceeds Limit, Controller Reports Error

**Step3**: Check the load configuration and installation method. Click "Initial Settings"->"Basic"-> "Load"->"End" to check whether the end load configuration on the web interface is the same as the actual installed load; click "Initial Settings"->"Basic"-> "Installation"->"Free Installation" to check whether the installation method on the web interface is the same as the actual installation method.

Friction compensation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the menu bar of "Initial" -> "Base" -> "Joint", click "Friction comp." to enter the friction compensation setting interface.

**Friction compensation coefficient**:The usage scenario for friction compensation is only in the dragging mode. The friction compensation coefficient can be set from 0 to 1. The higher the value, the greater the compensation force when dragging. The friction compensation coefficient needs to be set separately for each axis according to the different installation methods.

**Friction compensation switch**:Users can turn on or off friction compensation according to the actual robot and usage habits.

.. centered:: Figure 6.4-11 Friction Compensation Settings

.. important:: 
   The friction compensation function of the robot needs to be used with caution. According to the actual situation, a reasonable compensation coefficient should be set. Generally, the recommended median value is about 0.5.

Dragging Force Compensation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dragging force optimization builds upon the current current-loop dragging by compensating additional torque based on the robot's motion trend. This compensates for torque errors introduced by modeling inaccuracies and other factors, resulting in smoother robot dragging.

Robot Dragging Force Optimization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The dragging force optimization feature requires matching software and firmware versions to ensure optimal performance.

Dragging Force Optimization Configuration
************************************************
**Step1**: Log in to the web interface, navigate to "Initial Setup" -> "Basic" -> "Joints" -> "Friction Compensation" to access the dragging force compensation settings module, as shown in the figure.

.. image:: base/068.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.4-12 Dragging Force Compensation Settings Module

**Step2**: Set "Compensation Switch" to "ON" and "Adaptive Switch" to "OFF", configure parameters as shown in Figure 2-1, then click "Apply" to successfully enable the function. Press the drag button to drag the robot, and the dragging feel will be noticeably smoother than before enabling the function.

**Step3**: Parameter adjustment - the compensation coefficient range is [0-1]. If dragging feels slightly heavy, increase the parameter for the corresponding axis. If the robot fails to stop during dragging or joint vibration occurs, decrease the parameter for the corresponding axis. During dragging, a damping sensation will be present to decelerate and stop the robot.

**Step4**: To disable the dragging force compensation function, set "Compensation Switch" to "OFF".

I/O setup
--------------------

Pausing LUA Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the execution of a robot LUA program, clicking the "Pause/Resume" button will pause the LUA program, and the robot's status will change to "Pause". Clicking the button again will resume the program from the paused position, and the robot's status will return to "Running".

All running background processes will also be paused and resumed synchronously during this operation. Different types of LUA instructions behave differently when paused:

**① Motion Commands**:  
The robot stops immediately when paused. Upon resuming, the robot will continue moving to the target position specified by the command.

**② Logic Commands (SetDO, GetDI, GetInverseKinRef, etc.)**:  
If the program is paused during execution, these commands will complete their current operation before waiting for the LUA program to resume before proceeding to the next command.

**③ Wait Commands (WaitDI, ModbusMasterWaitDI, etc.)**:  
If paused during a wait operation, the pause duration does not count toward the wait timeout period.

**④ Sleep Commands (sleep_ms, WaitMs)**:  
If paused during a sleep operation, the pause duration does not count toward the specified sleep time.

Tool Tcp Automatic Calibration
-------------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot tool TCP (Tool Center Position, TCP) automatic calibration uses photoelectric sensor equipment (double tube cross type) to quickly calibrate the robot tool TCP. By counting the time when the tool triggers I/O signals in the photoelectric sensor device during robot movement, the conversion relationship between the robot end flange and the tool coordinate system is established, thereby accurately calibrating the robot tool coordinate system and improving the accuracy of the robot system.

Calibration process of coordinate system for sensor equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing robots
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install a robot with an absolute positioning accuracy of 1.2 mm on the work platform, and install a specialized tool for calibrating the coordinate system of the photoelectric sensor on the end flange of the robot.

.. image:: base/034.png
   :width: 2in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.7‑1 Example of robot installation

Installing sensor device
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Connect the two sets of brown, blue, and black signal wires of the photoelectric sensor device to the two sets of 24V, 0V, CI0, and CI1 ports (any available configurable digital signal input port is sufficient) of the robot control box. Power on the control box to start the robot and light up the X and Y axis beams of the photoelectric sensor device.

.. centered:: Figure 6.7‑2 Example of photoelectric sensor equipment

Setting up the TCP automatic calibration system coordinate system
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

According to the TCP automatic calibration system for robot tools, firstly, place the coarse positioning photoelectric sensor device in the flexible workspace of the robot, and ensure that the coordinate system of the photoelectric sensor device is roughly aligned with the robot base coordinate system.

As shown above, where {b} is the robot base coordinate system, {e} is the end flange coordinate system, and {s} is the sensor coordinate system.

.. image:: base/036.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.7‑3 Coordinate system setting for TCP automatic calibration system of robot tool

(1) adjust the posture of the robot's end flange to Rx, Ry, and Rz at 180 °, 0 °, and 0 °, respectively, and ensure that this posture remains unchanged throughout the entire calibration sensor device coordinate system movement process after adjustment;

(2) Then make the robot tool TCP perform MoveL motion together in the X and Y axis directions of the robot base coordinate system and the sensor coordinate system;

(3) During the movement of the robot, once the X and Y axis beams of the photoelectric sensor device always maintain the triggering I/O signal state, the installation position of the photoelectric sensor device can be accurately positioned as its current position.

Calibrate the sensor coordinate system based on the web interface
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the robot web control interface, click on "Initial" -> "Base" -> "Coordinate" -> "TCP" to enter the "Tool coordinate system settings" interface;

Select the reference coordinate system from the drop-down menu of "Coordinate system name", and choose the corresponding "Tool Type" and "Installation position", then click "Modify" to enter the "Modify Wizard" interface;

Select "Laser automatic calibration", enter the laser automatic calibration interface, click "Configuration", enter the "Laser calibration device configuration" interface, if there are previous settings, click "Modify".

Set I/O
***********************

Select the input port numbers for the control box of the X-axis laser beam and Y-axis laser beam, then click "Set". After successful settings, a green check mark will appear before the "Setup I/O" indicator.

.. centered:: Figure 6.7‑5 Example of setting the X and Y axis laser beam I/O ports of the laser sensor

Teaching center point
******************************

Drag the robot to trigger the X and Y axis beam I/O signals of the photoelectric sensor device using the TCP tool, and then move it along the Z+ axis direction of the base coordinate system to a position 5 mm above the measurement plane of the sensor device (where the X and Y axis beams intersect). 

.. warning:: Note that during this process, the end flange posture of the robot remains unchanged at Rx, Ry, and Rz, which are 180 °, 0 °, and 0 °, respectively. Then click "Record". After successful setting, a green check mark will appear before the "Setup center Point" marker.

   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.7‑6  The teaching TCP is located at the center of the sensor measurement plane

Set parameters
****************************

Set three custom parameters: "Movement radius", "Angular velocity", and "Depth of movement".

(1) The "Movement radius" parameter is the radius at which the robot tool performs circular motion. Referring to the effective measurement radius of the laser sensor used, which is 35 mm, it is recommended to set it to "10-15 mm". If it is too large, it may cause interference between the tool and the sensor, and if it is too small, it may cause interference between the X and Y axis laser I/O signals of the sensor;

(2) The "Angular velocity" parameter is the uniform angular velocity at which the robot tool moves in a circular motion. It is recommended to set it to "10-40 deg/s". If it is too large, it may cause impact vibration at the end of the tool and result in frame dropping of sensor I/O signals;

(3) The "Depth of movement" parameter is the Euclidean distance between the centers of the robot's two circular motions. The effective measurement height of the laser sensor used is 25 mm, and it is recommended to set it to "5-15mm". If it is too large, it may cause interference between the tool and the sensor.

Then click on "Set", and after successful settings, a green check mark will appear before the "Set Parameters" icon.

Run
*********************

In automatic mode, click "Run" to initiate the calibration operation of the sensor coordinate system. After the operation is completed, the interface displays the x, y, and z coordinate values of the calibrated sensor coordinate system and the attitude angles of Rx, Ry, and Rz. Then click "complete" to save the current data and exit the current interface.

.. centered:: Figure 6.7‑8 Example of calibration results for laser sensor coordinate system

.. warning:: Pay attention to the current operation. It is recommended that the robot perform this operation during the lifecycle of each production task (robot power off start operation) to prevent small displacement of sensor installation position caused by high-frequency vibration during operation and calculation errors caused by incorrect operation resulting in the release of sensor coordinate system calibration data in the controller.

Calibration process of tool coordinate system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After completing the "Laser device configured", if a green check mark appears in front of the label, it indicates that the laser sensor coordinate system has been successfully set. Remove the specialized tool for the end flange of the robot and install the unknown tool to be calibrated. Click "Calibrate" to start the TCP automatic calibration tool. After the operation is completed, the interface will display the calibration results.

Click "Save" to update the calibration result of the current tool TCP in the selected reference coordinate system from the drop-down menu of "Coordinate system name" in the "Current tool coordinate system" interface.

In the "Current tool coordinate system" interface, click "Apply" to apply the current tool TCP calibration result in the current reference tool coordinate system.

.. important:: 
  It should be noted that:

  （1）Note that before clicking "calibrate", you can avoid errors during the calibration tool coordinate system process by observing whether the x, y, and z coordinate results of the calibrated sensor coordinate system have significant errors compared to the actual sensor installation position. If the situation occurs, the reason may be that the robot tool TCP automatic calibration system coordinate system is set incorrectly, and the installation position of the laser sensor equipment needs to be adjusted before recalibrating the sensor coordinate system;

  （2）At the same time, after clicking "Calibrate", you can avoid errors in the process of calibrating the tool coordinate system by observing whether the robot adjusts the end flange attitude significantly (>90 °) after performing two circular movements. If the situation occurs, the reason may be that the "movement radius" parameter is set too small, causing interference in the sensor I/O signal. In this case, it is necessary to modify the "movement radius" parameter and click "calibrate" again;

  （3）In addition, it is recommended to calibrate the tool type with a cylindrical end, a spindle direction roughly parallel to the end flange spindle direction, and a radius within 10 mm. The measurable length of the tool end should be within 5-15 mm (not the overall length of the tool) to avoid interference with the sensor device.

TCP Calibration based on flatbed
-----------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the "four-point method" to carry out TCP calibration of tools, it is necessary to manually control the robot movement and realize the exact coincidence of points with the naked eye, and the calibration efficiency and accuracy are affected by the operator's proficiency.

The principle of TCP calibration based on flatbed is as follows: the robot tool is used to touch any position of the flatbed several times, and the TCP of the tool is solved by establishing a calibration model. The whole calibration process is automatically completed, which can improve the efficiency of calibration and reduce the dependence on manual work.

2The operation flow of TCP calibration function based on flatbed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix the calibration flatbed in the working space of the robot, the flatbed should not be shaken, and the electrical conductivity of the flatbed is good. The end of the tool is approximately vertical to the calibration flatbed, and is located 50mm above the flatbed.

Linear Rack Guideway Collision Detection
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Linear Rack Guideway Collision Detection function is used to achieve alarm and emergency stop when the guideway or robot collides with environmental objects during asynchronous or synchronous operation. By monitoring changes in the guideway torque feedback, it judges whether a collision has occurred based on a set threshold. If a collision occurs, the guideway stops immediately, thereby avoiding the application of continuous force by the guideway and robot on the collided object, further enhancing human-robot collaboration safety.

Linear Rack Guideway Collision Detection Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the Linear Rack Guideway Collision Detection function, the "Rail_Adaptation_Program.lua" program must be executed after the guideway is activated. This ensures the function can adapt to different guideways and loading conditions, obtaining the best collision detection performance. If adaptation is not performed, the collision detection performance will significantly decrease, and the external force required to trigger a collision will be greater.

Linear Rack Guideway Parameter Setting and Enabling
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Step1**: Log in to the web interface, click "Initial Setup" -> "Peripherals" -> "Extended Axes" in sequence to enter the Extended Axis Coordinate System setup module, as shown in Figure 2-1.

.. image:: base/078.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.10‑1 Extended Axis Coordinate System Setup Module

**Step2**: Based on the actual working conditions of the extended axis and the robot, set parameters and calibrate as needed. In Figure 2-1, click Edit, set the Extended Axis Coordinate System Name to "exaxis1", select the Scheme as "0-Single Degree of Freedom Linear Slide", and select the Extended Axis Number as "1". If the guideway and robot only run asynchronously, calibration may not be necessary. If synchronous operation is required, calibration is mandatory. Refer to the relevant user manual or consult professional personnel for the calibration process. After setting the parameters, click "Save" and apply the corresponding coordinate system, as shown in Figure 2-2.

.. image:: base/079.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.10‑2 Extended Axis Coordinate System Parameter Setting

**Step3**: Establish UDP communication between the extended axis and the robot, and ensure the extended axis PLC program can send back the torque feedback data of the extended axis drive motor (after the gearbox) to the robot controller. Click "Initial Setup" -> "Peripherals" -> "Extended Axes" in sequence to enter the UDP Communication Configuration page. Select the coordinate system set in Step 2 and apply it. Click the "Edit" icon for UDP Communication Configuration to configure and load the communication settings. The PLC and laptop IP addresses must be in the same subnet as the controller, as shown in Figure 2-3. Note: It is necessary to ensure that the extended axis PLC program can send back the torque feedback data of the extended axis drive motor (after the gearbox) to the robot controller, and the sampling period should ideally be 1ms, with a maximum not exceeding 4ms, otherwise the collision detection function will be invalid.

.. centered:: Figure 6.10‑3 UDP Communication Configuration Page

**Step4**: Configure UDP Extended Axis parameters. The UDP Extended Axis parameter setting page is shown in Figure 2-4. Select the Axis Type as "Linear Guideway", Axis Direction as "Positive", and configure the remaining parameters according to the actual situation. Among them, the Lead and Encoder Resolution are fixed and determined by the guideway; the upper limits of Running Speed and Acceleration are affected by the motor performance. The upper limits used in this function test are as shown in Figure 2-4. Please contact professional personnel when configuring different upper limits.

**Step5**: Enable the linear rack guideway and move it to the starting point. Enable the linear rack guideway via the "Remove Enable" button in Figure 2-4 or the "Servo Enable" button in Figure 2-5. If the slider on the guideway is far from the starting point, move it to the starting point using "Reverse Rotation" or "Forward Rotation" (note: the running speed needs to be away from 15%). After moving to the starting point, click "Zero Point Setting" and perform homing using the "Return to Zero from Current Position" method.

Enabling Linear Rack Guideway Collision Detection Function
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Step1**: Ensure the installation method of both the guideway and the robot is upright. Before enabling the linear rack guideway collision detection function, check if the installation method is upright. Specifically, first ensure the physical installation of the guideway and robot is upright. Then, click "Initial Setup" -> "Basic" -> "Installation" in sequence to enter the Free Installation page. If both "Base Rotation" and "Base Tilt" are 0, the software is set to upright installation; otherwise, they must be set to 0. If they are not 0, the interface will prompt an error, as shown in Figure 2-6.

   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.10‑6 Error Prompt if Installation Method is Not Upright

**Step2**: Enable the linear rack guideway collision detection function and set parameters. Click "Initial Setup" -> "Basic" -> "Joints" -> "Collision Level" in sequence to enter the Collision Level setting page. Click the slider for the "Linear Rack Guideway Collision Detection" function, then set the Gear Radius and Slider Mass. The Gear Radius can be calculated from the Lead and Reduction Ratio. The Slider Mass does not include the robot and its carried end load. The guideway level has 11 options, where Level1 is the easiest to trigger a collision, and Level10 is the most difficult. After the controller is powered on, and before executing the adaptation program, set the collision level to "Off" first.

.. image:: base/084.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.10‑7 Linear Rack Guideway Collision Detection Function

**Step3**: Execute the "Rail_Adaptation_Program.lua" program to adapt to the current guideway. After each controller restart, the "Rail_Adaptation_Program.lua" program must be executed (to prevent changes such as robot type from affecting the dynamic characteristics of the guideway). Before executing the program, ensure the guideway collision level is "Off". In automatic mode, run the lua program at 100% interface speed. Wait for the program to complete one cycle, indicating adaptation is complete, then it can be stopped.

.. centered:: Figure 6.10‑8 Execute "Rail_Adaptation_Program.lua" Program to Adapt to Current Guideway

**Step4**: Reasonably set the guideway collision level and execute tasks. Users can set the guideway collision level reasonably based on the motor drive performance and task running speed. If the guideway and robot are running asynchronously, colliding with the robot or guideway can trigger "Axis 8 Collision Fault, Resettable". At this time, the guideway stops running, as shown in Figure 2-9. If the guideway and robot are running synchronously, colliding with the robot can trigger an alarm, causing the guideway to stop running, and the robot will react according to the set collision strategy.

Force Sensor Loaded Zeroing and Open Posture Compliance Admittance Parameters
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Force Sensor Loaded Zeroing function is used to quickly clear the sensor's zero drift data when the robot, carrying the quick changer, replaces the load without disassembling the quick changer. The Open Posture Compliance Admittance Parameters allow customers to adjust the posture based on the actual torque magnitude in constant force control.

Force Sensor Loaded Zeroing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step1**: Install and activate the force sensor. Under the "Initial Setup" -> "Peripherals" -> "Force Sensor" menu, click "Adapted Devices" to enter the configuration interface. After the force sensor configuration is completed, select the configured force sensor number, click the "Reset" button. After the page pops up indicating the command was sent successfully, click the "Activate" button. Check the activation status in the force sensor information table to determine if activation was successful. Additionally, the force sensor will have initial values. Users can choose "Zero Calibration" and "Remove Zero" according to usage needs, as shown in Figure 2-1. Force sensor zero calibration requires ensuring the force sensor is installed vertically downward, and no load is configured below the sensor.

.. centered:: Figure 6.11‑1 Force Sensor Configuration Information

**Step2**: Force sensor load identification. Under the "Initial Setup" -> "Basic" -> "Load" menu, click "Auto Identification" to enter the Force/Torque Sensor Load interface. Perform sensor automatic zeroing, record the initial position, then switch the robot to automatic mode, and click "Auto Zero", as shown in Figure 2-2.

.. centered:: Figure 6.11‑2 Force Sensor Load Identification

**Step3**: If the actual load at the end of the force sensor is replaced, input the load weight and center of mass coordinates in the Load Configuration module, click "Apply" to update the load configuration and complete the force sensor loaded zeroing.

Open Posture Compliance Admittance Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step1**: Click "Initial Setup" -> "Basic" -> "Tool Coordinate" to enter the Tool Coordinate System setting interface. Select "Coordinate System Name" and set the coordinate system parameters corresponding to the end tool, as shown in Figure 3-1.

.. image:: base/089.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.11‑3 Tool Coordinate System Setting

**Step2**: Click "Teach Program" -> "Program Programming", write a constant force control lua script, select "Force Control Set" -> "Control", add a force control motion command, set Posture Compliance to "Enable", set the Inertia Coefficient and Damping Coefficient, and set the Maximum Adjustment Angle as the threshold for the posture compliance angle, as shown in Figure 3-2.

.. image:: base/090.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 6.11‑4 Open Posture Compliance Admittance Parameters

**Step3**: On the web interface, click "FT", set the force sensor reference coordinate system, select the reference coordinate system as "Custom Coordinate System" and set the corresponding coordinate system parameters to "0", as shown in Figure 3-3.

.. centered:: Figure 6.11‑5 Set Force Sensor Reference Coordinate System

**Step4**: Run the script and observe the posture compliance effect. The inertia parameter adjusts the acceleration response and anti-disturbance capability; the larger the inertia, the more obvious the robot lag. The damping coefficient affects the smoothness during posture compliance; the larger the damping, the more difficult the posture compliance.
