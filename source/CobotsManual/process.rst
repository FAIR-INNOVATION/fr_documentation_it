Straight Welding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click "Straight Welding" to enter the Straight Welding guidance interface. Based on the completion of basic robot settings, we can quickly generate welding teaching programs through a few simple steps. It mainly includes the following five steps. Due to functional mutual exclusion, the actual steps to generate one welding teaching program are fewer than five.

Step 1: Decide whether to use the extended axis. If using the extended axis, you need to configure the relevant coordinate system for the extended axis and enable it. Weaving function cannot be used when the extended axis is used.

.. image:: process/002.png

Multi-Layer Multi-Pass Welding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the weld leg size is greater than 10mm, the Multi-Layer Multi-Pass Welding function is typically used. This function enables template-based configuration of welding programs, incorporates arc tracking function during the first pass of multi-layer multi-pass welding, and corrects weld deviation in subsequent multi-pass straight welding processes, thereby improving weld quality.

The operation process for Arc Tracking Multi-Layer Multi-Pass Welding is as follows:

1) Set the Tool Coordinate System, enter the tool dimensions and posture of the welding torch.

.. note::
   The values on the interface are for example only; use the actual tool status.

Robot Conveyor Tracking System Composition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conveyor Encoder Data Communication Connection Method
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For machine tool processing, to achieve automated loading and unloading processes, a CNC function package based on FOCAS communication has been developed, enabling communication interaction and coordinated motion between collaborative robots and CNC machine tools.

As shown in the figure, FOCAS communication is based on Ethernet. By connecting the robot control box network port with the machine tool's embedded network port via an Ethernet cable, FOCAS communication between the robot and the machine tool can be established, enabling CNC control and machine tool status monitoring on the robot side.

.. figure:: process/038.png
   :align: center
   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 15.3‑6 Robot Conveyor Tracking System Composition Topology

In the system, (a) is the computer, (b) is the robot and its control box, (c) is the conveyor system consisting of the conveyor belt, photoelectric sensor, and encoder. The robot control box is connected to the photoelectric sensor and conveyor belt via digital IO communication, and connected to the conveyor encoder via RS485.

Conveyor Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Enter the Conveyor Tracking function configuration interface under "Basic Settings", "Peripherals", "Tracking" on the robot Web page to configure the conveyor tracking function properties.

.. figure:: process/039.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 15.3‑7 Conveyor Tracking Configuration Page

On the conveyor tracking configuration page, click the "Conveyor I/O One-Key Configuration" button to configure the conveyor physical connection with one click.
Then, in the "Function Selection" dropdown under "Parameter Configuration", select "Tracking Motion". Subsequently, configure the encoder properties, tracking workpiece coordinate system workpiece axis, vision pairing, and select "Chase Motion" in the "Tracking Type" dropdown. Then you can input the tracking start distance and tracking end distance.
Tracking Start Distance: After the tracking signal is triggered, the robot starts action after the conveyor runs the set distance. When set to -1, it triggers automatically.
Tracking End Distance: The maximum distance the robot follows the conveyor in synchronous motion after starting action.

Tracking Coordinate System Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Tracking motion uses the workpiece coordinate system as the conveyor coordinate system, so the workpiece coordinate system needs to be set.

Click "Initial Setup", "Basic", select "Workpiece Coordinate System" under "Coordinate System", click to select a workpiece coordinate system other than "wobjcoord0" for calibration. The calibration method is not detailed here.

.. figure:: process/040.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 15.3‑8 Tracking Coordinate System Setup

Conveyor Tracking Chase Motion Function
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Chase motion is a type of conveyor tracking motion. Compared to tracking motion, the teaching of motion points for chase motion does not need to be done above the workpiece coordinate system; it can be taught at any position in the workpiece coordinate system. Then, through the "Tracking Start Distance" parameter, the end effector synchronizes motion with the conveyor, making it a more flexible tracking method.

Conveyor Tracking Chase Motion Function Introduction
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following gives a chase motion example to introduce its motion characteristics.

.. figure:: process/041.png
   :align: center
   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 15.3‑9 Conveyor Tracking Chase Motion Teaching Example

Here, x is the direction of conveyor motion in the workpiece coordinate system, a is the conveyor plane, b is the target workpiece to be picked, c is the photoelectric sensor, d is the tracking start distance, e is the tracking end distance. P1 to P4 are the taught waypoints in sequential order, P2 to P3 are the same waypoint, including gripper motion.

.. figure:: process/042.png
   :align: center
   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 15.3‑10 Conveyor Tracking Chase Motion Execution Example After Teaching

When the above taught program starts running and the workpiece triggers the photoelectric switch signal, the robot will wait for the target to move under P1 before starting the tracking motion. The robot gripper will move along the trajectory shown in the figure above.

Chase Motion Program Teaching
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The chase motion program logic is basically the same as the tracking motion logic, including acquiring the trigger signal, acquiring conveyor data, and starting the tracking motion.

**Step 1**: Click "Teaching Program", "Program Programming", select and click the "Conveyor" button under "Peripheral Instructions" to enter the conveyor instruction configuration page.

   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 15.3‑11 A Typical Conveyor Blocking Tracking Picking Motion Program

When two identical tracking motion targets are taught consecutively (may include offset distance), and gripper motion is inserted in between, the robot will continuously track the conveyor at this target position until the gripper motion is completed, achieving blocking tracking picking.
