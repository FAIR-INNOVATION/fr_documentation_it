End-Effector Lua Custom Open Protocol
----------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The End-Effector Lua Custom Open Protocol supports the use of force sensors, grippers, and welding handles. It also supports the combined use of force sensors and grippers.

Operation Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step1**: Navigate to System Settings -> About -> Firmware Upgrade interface, select the end-effector firmware .bin file, and upgrade the end-effector firmware.

.. important::
   First, confirm whether the end-effector firmware version FV2.010.06 or later meets the requirements. If the version does not meet the requirements, upgrade the corresponding software firmware; otherwise, firmware upgrade is not necessary.

   Before uploading the end-effector firmware upgrade package, it is necessary to disable the robot and then enter boot mode.

Force Sensor
-------------------------

In the "Initial" -> "Peripherals" -> "Force Sensor" interface, force sensors can currently be used via Pre-Adapted Devices and the End-Effector Lua Custom Open Protocol.

Pre-Adapted Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step1**: Click "Pre-Adapted Devices" to enter the end-effector peripheral configuration interface.

The force sensor configuration information includes manufacturer, type, software version, and mounting position. Users can configure the corresponding force sensor information according to specific production needs. If the user needs to change the configuration, they can first select the corresponding number, click the "Clear" button to clear the corresponding information, and reconfigure according to the requirements;

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/016.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.3‑1 Force Sensor Configuration

.. important::
	Before clicking to clear the configuration, the corresponding sensor should be in an inactive state.

**Step2**: After the force sensor configuration is completed, the user can view the corresponding force sensor information in the information table at the bottom of the page. If a configuration error is found, click the "Clear" button to reconfigure.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/017.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.3‑2 Force Sensor Configuration Information

**Step3**: Select the configured force sensor number, click the "Reset" button, after the page pops up indicating the command was sent successfully, then click the "Activate" button. Check the activation status in the force sensor information table to determine whether the activation was successful; Additionally, the force sensor will have an initial value. The user can choose "Zero Calibration" and "Remove Zero" according to usage requirements. Force sensor zero calibration requires ensuring the force sensor is level and vertically downward, and the robot has no configured load.

**Step4**: After the force sensor configuration is completed, it is necessary to configure the sensor type tool coordinate system. The sensor tool coordinate system values can be directly input and applied based on the distance between the sensor and the end-effector tool center.

Sensor Load Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the "Initial" -> "Basic" -> "Load" menu bar, click "Sensor Identification" to enter the sensor load identification interface.

Specific Pose Identification: Clear the end-effector load data, configure the force sensor, establish the sensor coordinate system, adjust the robot end-effector posture to vertical downward, perform "Zero Calibration" and then install the end-effector load. First, select the corresponding sensor tool coordinate system, adjust the robot so that the sensor and tool are vertical downward, record data, and calculate the mass. Then, adjust the robot to 3 different postures, record three sets of data respectively, calculate the center of mass, confirm it is correct and click Apply.

**Dynamic Identification**: Clear the end-effector load data, configure the force sensor, establish the sensor coordinate system, adjust the robot end-effector posture to vertical downward, perform "Zero Calibration" and then install the end-effector load. Click "Identification Start", drag the robot to move, then click "Identification Stop", and the load result will be automatically applied to the robot.

**Auto Zero**: After the sensor records the initial position, it can automatically zero.

Force Sensor Assisted Dragging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After configuring the sensor, it can be paired with the sensor to provide better assistance for dragging the robot. For the first use, you can configure according to the data in the right figure. After applying, you do not need to enter the drag mode; directly drag the end-effector force sensor to control the robot to move in a fixed posture. (The data in the figure below is a reference standard)

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/019.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.3‑4 Force/Torque Sensor Drag Lock

.. note::
   Singularity Strategy is a function developed under force sensor assisted locking for singularity crossing and avoidance.

   Singularity Avoidance Strategy is the default function option. After enabling assisted dragging, the avoidance function is enabled by default. Singularity avoidance is a function that applies virtual force to move the robot away from a singular configuration when the robot is in a singular pose.

   Singular Configurations:

   **Elbow Singularity**: Rotation axes 2, 3, and 4 are in the same plane. At this time, the elbow joint is fully extended or fully contracted. Due to FR robot mechanical limits, the fully contracted configuration cannot be reached.

   **Wrist Singularity**: Rotation axes 4 and 6 are parallel. Due to FR robot mechanical limits, this configuration cannot be reached.

   **Shoulder Singularity**: The wrist center point is located in the plane formed by rotation axes 1 and 2.

   Singularity Crossing Function: Select "Singularity Strategy" as "Cross" and apply. When the robot detects that the current pose is in a singular configuration, it automatically switches to the current loop drag mode. When it detects exiting the singular configuration, the drag mode switches back to force sensor assisted dragging to continue motion.

**Adaptive Selection**: Enable when assembly is required; after enabling, dragging becomes heavier;

**Inertia Parameters**: Adjust the feel during the dragging process, operate with caution under the guidance of technical personnel.

**Damping Parameters**:

-  Translation Direction: Recommended parameter range [100-200];
-  Rotation Direction: Recommended parameter range [3-10], with the RZ direction range [0.1-5];
-  Effect: When dragging with the sensor, increasing damping makes dragging difficult, decreasing damping makes dragging the robot too easy (recommended not to set too small);
-  Overall Damping Parameter Range: Translation XYZ: [100-1000]; Rotation RX, RY: [3-50], RZ: [2-10];
-  Maximum Drag Force is 50, Maximum Drag Speed is 180.

**Stiffness Parameters**: All set to 0;

**Drag Force Threshold**: Translation XYZ: [5-10]; Rotation RX, RY, RZ: [0.5-5];

.. important::
   Locking is achieved by increasing the force threshold for translation directions XYZ or rotation directions RX, RY, RZ.

Force/Torque Sensor Collision Detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command Description: The "FT_Guard" command is the collision detection command. Select the corresponding sensor coordinate system, check the effective torque direction detection, set the current value, maximum collision threshold, and minimum collision threshold. The normal collision detection condition range is (Current Value - Min Threshold, Current Value + Max Threshold). Add the "Enable" and "Disable" commands to the program.

Force/Torque Sensor Force Control Motion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command Description: The "FT_Control" command is the force control motion command, which allows the robot to move near the set force, commonly used in grinding scenarios. Select the corresponding sensor coordinate system, check the effective torque direction detection, set the detection threshold, and the PID proportional coefficients in each direction (generally set p to 0.001), set the maximum adjustment distance (for X,Y,Z) and maximum adjustment angle (for RX,RY,RZ). Add the "Enable" and "Disable" commands to the program.

Welding Pendant
-------------------------------------------------------------

In the "Initial" -> "Peripherals" -> "Welding Pendant" interface, the welding pendant can currently be used through adapted devices and the end Lua custom open protocol.

Adapted Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration Steps
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Step1**: Click the "Adapted Devices" card to enter the Adapted Devices interface. The configuration information is divided into Manufacturer, Type, Software Version, and Mounting Position. Users can configure the corresponding information according to specific production needs. If users need to change the configuration, they can first select the corresponding manufacturer, click the "Clear" button to clear the corresponding information, and reconfigure according to requirements.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/029.png

   :width: 3in

.. centered:: Figure 8.4‑1 Welding Pendant Adapted Device Configuration

.. important::
    The corresponding device should be in an inactive state before clicking to clear the configuration.

**Step2**: Configure key positions A-E and the IO key sequentially. After the Smart Tool configuration is completed, the task manager internally maintains the function corresponding to each button. When it detects that a button is pressed, it automatically executes the function item corresponding to that button.

A-E Key Functions:

- New Program
- Save Program
- PTP
- Lin
- ARC
- Start Weave Weld
- End Weave Weld
- IO Port

-  **Motion Command**: When selecting PTP, LIN, or ARC motion commands, the corresponding point speed needs to be entered. After successful configuration, a related motion command is added to the teach program. When configuring the ARC motion command, the PTP/LIN command must be configured first.
  
-  **DO Output**: When selecting "DO Output", a dropdown menu is displayed allowing selection of DO0⁓DO7 options.

.. image:: robot_peripherals/030.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 8.4‑2 A-E Keys

IO Key Functions:

-  **IO Signal Configuration**: The dropdown menu allows selection of DO0⁓DO7 options, CO0⁓CO7 options, End-DO0, End-DO1, and extended IO (Aux-DO0⁓Aux-DO127);

-  **Combined Command**: After selecting "IO Signal", under specific conditions, the "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" configuration items are displayed, generating different program commands.

.. important::
   -  When the IO signal is configured as DO0~DO7 or CO0~CO7 (without "Arc Start" configured), the program adds SetDO; "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" are hidden at this time.
   -  When the IO signal is configured as End-DO0 or End-DO1, the program adds SetToolDO; "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" are hidden at this time.
   -  When the IO signal is configured as extended IO (without "Welder Arc Start" configured), the program adds SetAuxDO; "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" are hidden at this time.
   -  When the IO signal is configured as CO0~CO7 (with "Arc Start" configured) and "Welder Selection" is "None", the program adds SetDO; "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" are hidden at this time.
   -  When the IO signal configuration item is extended IO (with "Welder Arc Start" configured) and "Welder Selection" is "None", the program adds SetAuxDO; "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" are hidden at this time.
   -  When the IO signal is configured as CO0~CO7 (with "Arc Start" configured) or extended IO (with "Welder Arc Start" configured), and "Welder Selection" is "Welding", the first press adds ARCStart, the second adds ARCEnd, the third adds ArcStart, the fourth adds ARCStart, alternating and repeating the above operations; "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" are hidden at this time.
   -  When the IO signal is configured as CO0~CO7 (with "Arc Start" configured) or extended IO (with "Welder Arc Start" configured), and "Welder Selection" is "LIN+Welding", the first press adds LIN and ARCStart, the second adds LIN and ARCEnd, the third adds LIN and ARCStart, the fourth adds LIN and ARCEnd, alternating and repeating the above operations; "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" are displayed at this time.
   -  When the IO signal is configured as CO0~CO7 (with "Arc Start" configured) or extended IO (with "Welder Arc Start" configured), and "Welder Selection" is "LIN+Welding+Weaving", the first press adds LIN, ARCStart, and WeaveStart, the second adds LIN, ARCEnd, and WeaveEnd, the third adds LIN, ARCStart, and WeaveStart, the fourth adds LIN, ARCEnd, and WeaveEnd, alternating and repeating the above operations; "Welder Selection" and "Point Speed" are hidden at this time.

Custom Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click "Custom Protocol" to enter the end Lua open protocol adaptation welding pendant function interface.

Protocol Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When using the open protocol to adapt the welding pendant, it is necessary to first enter the web page for open protocol upload configuration after the robot is powered on and starts.

Click "Custom Protocol Upload", click "Enter Boot", click "Upload" open protocol. After the upload is completed, restart the device to use the end Lua open protocol to adapt the welding pendant.

Welding Machine
--------------------------

Collaborative robots carrying welding torches for welding operations can significantly improve welding efficiency and quality. Faro collaborative robots can control welding through three methods: "Controller IO", "Digital Communication Protocol (UDP)", or "Digital Communication Protocol (Modbus TCP)":

**Controller IO**: The robot controls the welding current and voltage by setting the control box analog output (0-10V), controls welding arc initiation, wire feeding, and gas supply through the control box digital output, and collects signals such as welder ready and arc success through the control box digital input.

**Digital Communication Protocol (UDP)**: The robot communicates with a PLC via UDP, and the PLC then communicates with the welding machine via CANOpen bus or other protocols to control welding voltage, current, and operations like arc initiation, wire feeding, and gas supply (Refer to Appendix 1 for the robot UDP communication protocol content).

**Digital Communication Protocol (Modbus TCP)**: This refers to the controller peripheral open protocol, typically a runnable LUA program. The program includes commands for creating communication, cyclically writing control data to the slave device, and reading real-time status data. When this LUA program is executed, the robot establishes communication with the device and performs data exchange. The IP address, port number, cycle, and other communication parameters can be customized in the controller peripheral open protocol LUA program. Users need to modify the protocol content according to the actual device situation when using it. Devices supported by the controller peripheral open protocol include grinding heads, laser sensors, CNC, welding machines, etc. The controller peripheral open protocol file name must start with `CtrlDev_`, such as "CtrlDev_Welding.lua". A maximum of 4 open protocols can run simultaneously.

Welding control via "Controller IO" or "Digital Communication Protocol (UDP)" mainly includes the following steps: ① Welding torch installation and signal wiring; ② Welding machine parameter configuration; ③ Writing welding control programs.

Welding Torch Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The welding torch is installed at the robot end via an adapter plate, and the welding torch cable must be fixed to the robotic arm.

.. centered:: Figure 8.6‑2 Welding Torch Installed at Robot End

After the welding torch is fixed and installed, calibrate the welding torch tool coordinate system using the six-point method and apply it as the current tool coordinate system. The calibration accuracy of the welding torch tool coordinate system will affect the actual welding accuracy.

Welding Machine Parameter Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collaborative robots can control the welding process through "Controller IO" signals or "Digital Communication Protocol". The configuration operations for these two methods mainly differ in the following two points:

① When using "Controller IO", it is necessary to set the correspondence between the actual controlled welding current/voltage and the control box analog output values.

② When using "Digital Communication Protocol", communication parameters need to be configured.

"Controller IO" Welding Control Configuration

In the "Initial" -> "Peripherals" -> "Welding Machine" menu bar, click the "Controller I/O" card to enter the interface.

Welding IO Signal Configuration
********************************************************

As shown in the figure below, select the DI input ports for the welder status signals and the DO output ports for the welder control signals, then click the "Configure" button. The meanings of each signal are as follows:

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/040.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.6-5 Set Welding Machine Signal Ports

**Welder Ready**: This signal is output from the welding machine to the robot when the welding machine is ready to perform welding operations.

When the welding machine is not ready due to faults or other reasons, this signal is not input to the robot. At this time, the robot WebApp prompt in the upper right corner "Welder not ready". If your welding machine does not have a welder ready signal, you can set this port to "None".

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/042.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.6-7 Welder Ready Set to "None"

**Arc Success**: The arc has been successfully initiated. After the robot outputs the arc initiation signal to the welding machine, it waits for the arc success feedback signal from the welding machine. If the robot does not detect the arc success signal from the welding machine within the set timeout period, the robot reports an "Arc initiation timeout" error.

If the arc success signal is not configured, welding can still be performed using the robot welding function, but the robot will report a "Arc success DI not configured" warning. If your welding machine has an arc success signal output, we recommend configuring this signal for safer welding.

   :width: 3in

.. centered:: Figure 8.6-9 Arc Success DI Not Configured Warning

**Welding Interruption Recovery**: Triggered when the arc is unexpectedly interrupted during robot welding or the operator actively pauses welding. When this signal input to the robot changes from invalid to valid after a welding interruption, the robot automatically resumes welding from the original interruption position.

**Welding Interruption Exit**: Triggered when the arc is unexpectedly interrupted during robot welding or the operator actively pauses welding. When this signal input to the robot changes from invalid to valid after a welding interruption, the robot terminates welding. After termination, welding cannot be resumed.

**Welding Arc Initiation**: The DO output port through which the robot controls the welding machine to initiate the arc. When the robot program executes the arc initiation command, the corresponding DO output port for arc initiation automatically outputs a valid signal.

**Gas Detection**: The DO output port through which the robot controls the welding machine to supply gas. When the robot executes the welding gas supply command, the corresponding DO output port for gas supply automatically outputs a valid signal.

**Forward Wire Feed**: The DO output port through which the robot controls the welding machine for forward wire feeding. When the robot executes the forward wire feed command, the corresponding DO output port for forward wire feed automatically outputs a valid signal.

**Reverse Wire Feed**: The DO output port through which the robot controls the welding machine for reverse wire feeding. When the robot executes the reverse wire feed command, the corresponding DO output port for reverse wire feed automatically outputs a valid signal.

Welding Process Parameter Configuration
********************************************************

As shown in the figure below, find the "Welding Process Parameters" section on the welding configuration page. The collaborative robot provides 100 sets of welding process parameters, numbered 0 to 99. Process number 0 indicates not using the welding process curve, while process numbers 1-99 use the welding process curve.
   
.. figure:: robot_peripherals/045.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.6-10 Welding Process Parameter Configuration

When using the welding process curve, take selecting welding process number 1 as an example. Input the parameters from Arc Initiation Current to Arc Closing Time as shown in Figure 8, then click the "Configure" button. The actual welding process represented by these parameters is as follows:

① Set welding current 200A, voltage 23V;
② Execute arc initiation, wait for arc success;
③ After arc success, maintain the arc for 500ms (Arc initiation time, robot does not move);
④ Set welding current 150A, welding voltage 21V, then the robot starts moving and performs welding;
⑤ After welding to the end point, set welding current to 100A, welding voltage to 19V (Arc closing current, Arc closing voltage);
⑥ After setting the arc closing current and voltage, maintain arc burning for 500ms (robot does not move), finally extinguish the arc.

When not using the welding process curve, i.e., selecting welding process parameter number 0, as shown below, the welding process is:
① Set welding current and welding voltage;
② The robot controls the welding machine to initiate the arc and waits for arc success;
③ After arc success, the robot starts moving and performs welding;
④ The robot extinguishes the arc immediately after welding to the end point.

Setting the Relationship Diagram Between Welding Current/Voltage and Analog Output
***************************************************************************************************************************

When the collaborative robot welding control type is selected as "Controller IO", the welding current and voltage values are controlled by the magnitude of the control box analog output (control box analog output voltage range is 0 ~ 10V). At this time, it is necessary to configure the linear correspondence between the control box analog output value and the actual welding current and welding voltage values.

As shown in Figure 12, find the "Analog Current Voltage Relationship Diagram" on the welding machine configuration page. "A-V" represents the correspondence between welding current and the control box output analog voltage, and "V-V" represents the correspondence between welding voltage and the control box output analog voltage.

Select "A-V", input the welding current range 0-1000A, analog output voltage 0-10V, output AO as "Ctrl-AO0" (the analog output port for welding current control is AO0), click the "Configure" button; Under these parameters, when the control box outputs an analog voltage of 1.5V, it corresponds to a welding current of 150A.
   
.. figure:: robot_peripherals/047.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.6-12 Welding Current vs Output Analog Correspondence Configuration

As shown in Figure 13, click "V-V" to set the correspondence between welding voltage and the control box analog output voltage. Input the welding voltage range as 0-60V, the analog output voltage value as 0-10V, and the output AO as "Ctrl-AO1" (the analog output port for welding voltage control is AO1), then click the "Configure" button. In this case, if the control box AO1 analog output is 3.5V, it actually controls the welding voltage to be 21V.

Welding Machine Debugging
**********************************************

As shown in Figure 14, find "Welding Machine Debugging" on the welding machine configuration page. Select process number 1, input the timeout time as 1000ms, click "Gas On", and the robot will control the welding machine to start supplying shielding gas. Click the "Gas Off" button, and the robot will control the welding machine to stop supplying shielding gas. The operation methods for other buttons like "Arc Start", "Forward Wire Feed", "Reverse Wire Feed", etc., are the same and will not be repeated.

"Digital Communication Protocol (UDP)" Welding Control Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the robot uses the "Digital Communication Protocol" for welding control, it essentially communicates with a PLC via UDP. The robot transmits control data such as arc initiation, wire feeding, gas supply, current, and voltage to the PLC via UDP communication. The PLC then further controls the welding machine via CANOpen bus (or other methods). Simultaneously, the PLC collects actual welding current, voltage, and arc success signals and feeds them back to the robot. (Refer to Appendix 1 for the robot UDP communication protocol content).

In the "Initial" -> "Peripherals" menu bar, click "Welding Machine" to enter the welding machine configuration interface. As shown below:
   
.. figure:: robot_peripherals/050.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.6-15 Digital Communication Protocol (UDP)

Since the robot communicates with the PLC via UDP, UDP communication parameters need to be configured. The meanings of these parameters are as follows:

**IP Address**: The IP address of the PLC end for UDP communication.
**Port Number**: The UDP communication port number on the PLC end.
**Communication Cycle**: The cycle for UDP communication between the robot and the PLC, default is 2ms.
**Packet Loss Detection Cycle, Packet Loss Count**: When the number of lost packets within the packet loss detection cycle exceeds the set value, the robot reports a "UDP communication packet loss exception" error and automatically cuts off the communication.
**Communication Interruption Confirmation Duration**: If the robot does not receive a complete frame of PLC feedback data within this duration, it reports a "UDP communication interruption" error alarm and cuts off the UDP communication.
**Auto-reconnect after Power Restart**: Whether the robot automatically attempts to reconnect and recover after detecting a robot power restart.
**Auto-reconnect after Communication Interruption**: Whether the robot automatically attempts to reconnect and recover after detecting a UDP communication interruption.
**Reconnection Cycle, Reconnection Count**: When auto-reconnect after UDP communication interruption is enabled and a interruption is detected, the robot attempts reconnection at the set cycle. If the reconnection count reaches the maximum set value and the connection is still not successful, the robot reports a "UDP communication interruption" error alarm and cuts off the UDP communication.

After configuring the above parameters, click the "Configure" button. After successful configuration, click the "Load" button.

When the welding machine is not ready due to faults or other reasons, this signal is not input to the robot. At this time, the robot WebApp prompt in the upper right corner "Welder not ready". If your welding machine does not have a welder ready signal, you can set this port to "-1".

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When using the welding process curve (i.e., selecting welding process parameter numbers 1 ~ 99), the voltage and current control during the welding process follows the curve parameters set for a specific process number, and there is no need to separately add instructions to set welding voltage and current. As shown in Figure 25, click "Teach" -> "Program Programming", and create a new user program "testWeld.lua".

In the opened welding instruction addition page, select the control type as "Controller I/O" (select based on the actual configured welding control method), select the welding process number as 1 (Process number 0 does not use the welding process curve, numbers 1-99 do), set the maximum wait time as 10000ms, click the "Arc Start" button and then the "Arc Close" button sequentially, and finally click "Apply".

Now the "testWeld.lua" program has added the welding arc start instruction and the welding arc close instruction. Since the arc start and close operations selected welding process curve number 1, the voltage and current control during the welding process follows the curve parameters set for process number 1, and there is no need to separately add instructions to set welding voltage and current.

In the opened welding instruction addition page, select the control type as "Controller I/O" (select based on the actual configured welding control method), select the welding process number as 0 (Process number 0 does not use the welding process curve, numbers 1-99 do), set the welding current control AO as "Ctrl-AO0", welding current as 150A, click the "Add" button; set the welding voltage control AO as "Ctrl-AO1", welding voltage as 21V, click the "Add" button; set the maximum wait time as 10000ms, click the "Arc Start" button and then the "Arc Close" button sequentially, and finally click "Apply".

Now the "testWeld.lua" program has added the welding arc start instruction and the welding arc close instruction. Since the arc start and close instructions selected welding process number 0, when the program executes the set welding voltage and current instructions, the robot will automatically output the corresponding control box analog signal based on the set welding voltage and current values and the "Welding voltage, current vs output analog correspondence" set in the welding machine configuration page.

Add two linear motion instructions and adjust the instruction order so that the robot first moves to point "P1", executes arc start, then moves to point "P2", and executes arc close, achieving welding from point "P1" to point "P2".

Running the above program will achieve welding along a straight line P1 ~ P2. Before running the program, please check:
① Whether the welding torch is correctly installed, whether the welding torch tool coordinate system has been calibrated, and applied as the current tool coordinate system;
② Whether the welding power supply, gas path, and wire feed path are working normally;
③ Whether the signal line connections between the robot and the welding machine are normal.

Welding Interruption and Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welding interruption may occur during robot welding under the following circumstances:
① The operator actively pauses welding to observe the actual welding condition or perform operations like cleaning the nozzle;
② Unexpected welding arc interruption;
③ The robot collides, causing welding to pause;

After a welding interruption occurs during robot welding, the operator can switch the robot to manual mode, drag the robot to a safe position, and address the cause of the interruption.

After the issue is resolved, the collaborative robot can automatically move from the current position back to the position where the welding interruption occurred, re-ignite the arc, and resume welding. The specific operation process is:
① Configure welding interruption recovery parameters;
② Execute the welding program, pause welding during the process to cause an interruption;
③ Switch the robot to manual mode, handle the relevant issues, then switch the robot back to automatic mode after completion;
④ Click the "Resume Welding" button, and the robot automatically resumes welding.

Welding Interruption Recovery Parameter Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the "Initial" -> "Peripherals" menu bar, click "Welding Machine" to enter the welding machine configuration interface. Find the "Detect Arc Interruption Parameter Configuration" section, turn on "Function Enable", input "Confirmation Duration" as 20ms, click the "Configure" button. This means that if the arc success signal remains invalid for more than 20ms during welding, the robot will report a "Welding arc interruption" error.

.. centered:: Figure 8.6-33 Detect Arc Interruption Parameter Configuration

Find the "Welding Interruption Recovery Parameter Configuration" section, turn on "Function Enable", input "Overlap Distance" as 5mm, "Speed" as 10%, "Motion Mode" as "PTP", click the "Configure" button. The explanations for these three parameters are as follows:

**Overlap Distance**: To ensure the continuity between the resumed weld and the weld before the interruption, the arc restart point for welding recovery needs to have a certain overlap distance with the original weld.

**Speed**: After a welding interruption, the robot often needs to be moved to a safe position and the weld needs to be treated. After treatment is completed and welding recovery is executed, the robot will move from the current position to the welding restart point. This "Speed" indicates the speed at which the robot moves to the restart point.

**Motion Mode**: After a welding interruption, the robot often needs to be moved to a safe position and the weld needs to be treated. After treatment is completed and welding recovery is executed, the robot will move from the current position to the welding restart point. This "Motion Mode" indicates the motion mode used by the robot to move to the restart point, with "LIN" and "PTP" available for selection.

Welding Interruption Recovery Application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Take the "testWeld" program as an example. Switch the robot to automatic mode, click the start button, and the robot begins welding. During welding, click the pause button. At this point, welding is interrupted, and a welding interruption recovery prompt box pops up in the WebApp right corner. Click the "Resume Welding" button, and the robot automatically moves to the restart point and executes the subsequent welding tasks.

.. warning::
   The collaborative robot welding interruption recovery function can only be used for linear welds or circular arc welds. When using a while (1) loop for welding, nested multi-layer while loops are not supported, and conditional judgment statements containing local variables cannot be included. If using stitch welding function, please pay attention to adding the interface for feedback stitch welding information.

Attachment 1: Robot UDP Communication Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
  1) CRC check method: Uses modbus 16 check but only takes the lower 8 bits for verification. The data areas for verification are D100-D176, D200-D273.

  2) Arc Tracking: The actual current feedback converts the actual current obtained by the PLC from the welder into an analog value of 0-4095 and transmits it to the analog channel 0 of the UDP data protocol, i.e., D168.

  3) Speed conversion logic: Robot issued speed (unit mm/s) V ÷ lead × 60 = V';
     PLC converts the robot issued speed V' × encoder resolution ÷ 60 = V" (unit pulse/s).

Welder Open Protocol
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The robot communicates with the welder via the controller peripheral open protocol using ModbusTCP. Write the corresponding communication protocol LUA file according to the welder slave register definitions. Configure communication parameters such as the welder IP address, port number, and register addresses for arc start control, wire feed control, etc., in this file. Upload this protocol to the robot controller and load it to enable communication between the robot and the welder.

Welder Open Protocol Analysis
******************************************************

The welder open protocol mainly consists of three parts:

**① Establish Communication Connection**: Specify the protocol number id (must match the protocol number set when loading the open protocol), welder IP address, port number, and other parameters. Use the "ModbusTCPMasterCreate()" command to establish a ModbusTCP connection between the robot and the welder.

**② Cyclically Write Control Data to Welder**: When the welder open protocol executes, it first reads the current welder control data from the robot controller's internal memory, then writes this data to the welder to control its actions. The return values of the instruction "WeldingGetCtrlState()", which reads robot welding control data in the protocol, are defined in Table 2-1. The control data can be decomposed according to the actual welder control register definitions and then written to the welder via ModbusTCP.

**③ Cyclically Read Status Data from Welder**: The welder open protocol first reads real-time status data from the welder via ModbusTCP, then writes the relevant data to the robot controller, allowing the robot to monitor the welder's real-time action status. The parameter for the protocol's interface "WeldingSetRealtimeState()", which sets the welder status in the robot, is an array containing all welder statuses (note: in the open protocol LUA, array indexing starts from 1) as shown in Table 2-2. The welder status data read via ModbusTCP according to the actual welder status register definitions can be combined into the welder status array and written to the robot controller.

.. centered:: Figure 8.7‑1 Initial Extended Axis Configuration Interface

Currently, Extended Axis Peripheral configuration is divided into the following two types based on communication method:

- Controller + PLC (UDP Communication).

- Controller + Servo Drive (485 Communication).

Extended Axis Coordinate System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Extended Axis Coordinate System settings interface allows for the application, clearing, and configuration of the extended axis coordinate system.

The current extended axis solutions are as follows:

- 0 - Single Degree of Freedom Linear Slide

- 1 - Two Degree of Freedom L-type Positioner

- 2 - Three Degree of Freedom (Temporarily unavailable)

- 3 - Four Degree of Freedom (Temporarily unavailable)

- 4 - Single Degree of Freedom Positioner

- 5 - Two Degree of Freedom AGV

**Single Degree of Freedom Linear Slide**: First set the DH parameters, then set the robot's position relative to the extended axis (the linear slide is considered *on* the extended axis). If not calibrating, just click Save; at this point, the extended axis can only move asynchronously.

   1. The extended axis coordinate system is calibrated based on the tool coordinate system and needs to be established on the basis of an already created tool coordinate system.
   2. Extended axis systems generally use exaxis1~exaxis4. Applying exaxis0 means no extended axis coordinate system is used. When calibrating an extended axis coordinate system, first apply the extended axis coordinate system to exaxis0, then select another extended axis coordinate system for calibration and application.

Controller + PLC (UDP Communication)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using the extended axis UDP communication method, it is necessary to first establish the corresponding extended axis coordinate system, configure the corresponding extended axis solution under that coordinate system, and apply the established tool coordinate system during program teaching. The extended axis function is primarily used in conjunction with the welding machine function and the laser tracking sensor function.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/099.png

When only needing to modify the current extended axis coordinate system, select the coordinate system in the Peripheral Extended Axis configuration interface to apply it. When needing to change the extended axis solution, enter the Extended Axis Coordinate System configuration interface to modify it.

When the extended axis solution is "0 - Single Degree of Freedom Linear Slide", "1 - Two Degree of Freedom L-type Positioner", "2 - Three Degree of Freedom", "3 - Four Degree of Freedom", or "4 - Single Degree of Freedom Positioner", after successful UDP communication configuration, the interface displays "UDP Extended Axis" and "Positioning Completion Time Setting" content. When the extended axis solution is "5 - Two Degree of Freedom AGV", the interface displays "Two Degree of Freedom AGV Test" content.

Controller + Servo Drive (485 Communication)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware Wiring
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before using RS485 communication to control the servo extended axis, please first connect the RS485 communication interface of the servo drive to the RS485 communication interface on the robot control box. The electrical interface diagram for the Faro Robot Yizhizao control box is as follows:

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/122.png
   :align: center
   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 8.7‑32 Faro Robot Mini Control Box Electrical Interface Diagram

Taking the Dynatek servo drive model FD100-750C as an example, refer to the drive panel terminal diagram and the X3A-IN terminal definition of the FD100-750C. When configuring the robot to communicate with the FD100-750C servo extended axis, it is necessary to connect the 485-A0 terminal and 485-B0 terminal on the control box to pins 4 and 5 of the drive's X3A-IN terminal, respectively. (Please note: You might see a terminal marked "485" on the servo drive panel. This terminal is currently not available for user use. Do not connect your RS485 communication cable to this terminal). Additionally, if connecting multiple servo drives and this drive is the last in the chain, it is necessary to turn on the RS485 communication termination resistor dip switch (No. 2 dip switch) on the panel.

Servo Motion
************************

Before actually controlling the servo motor motion, please first understand the "Position Mode" and "Speed Mode" of the servo motor. We remind you again:

**Position Mode**: You can input a certain motion speed and target position parameter. The servo will move to the target position at the set speed and stop after reaching the target position.

**Speed Mode**: You can input a certain target speed. The servo will continue to move at the target speed you set until you set the target speed to 0 or disable the servo motor;

When switching control modes, the "Current Control Mode" display will switch automatically (Please note: After switching the control mode, you need to first disable the servo, then enable the servo again for the servo control mode switch to take effect). If your servo is not currently in "Position Mode", please switch your servo to position mode. Enter the "Target Position" as 50mm and the run speed as 5mm/s. Under confirmed safe conditions, click the "Set" button. At this point, the servo motor will move according to the parameters you set. You can observe the servo's position, speed, etc., in real-time in the "Servo" section of the robot's various status bars.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/132.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.7‑40 Servo Motion Debugging (Position Mode)

Change the servo control mode to "Speed Mode". Click the "Enable" status button to disable the servo drive, then click the "Disable" status button. Now the servo is switched to speed mode (Please note: After the servo motor starts moving, it can only be stopped by setting the target speed to 0). Enter the target speed as 5mm/s and click the "Set" button. The servo motor will maintain motion at 5mm/s. Similarly, you can observe the servo's position, speed, etc., in real-time in the "Servo" section of the robot's various status bars.

Summary
++++++++++++++

In summary, the key points for configuring RS485 communication between the collaborative robot and the servo extended axis are as follows:

1. Correctly connect the RS485 communication cable between the collaborative robot and the servo drive;

2. Correctly select the control mode for the servo extended axis;

3. After switching the control mode, you must first disable the servo, then enable the servo again for the control mode switch to take effect.

Line Laser Sensor
---------------------------------------------

The F&R collaborative robot is used in conjunction with a laser sensor to identify feature positions such as welds, achieving the goals of simplified programming and improved production efficiency. The collaborative robot can be adapted to laser sensors from three manufacturers: Ruiniu, Chuangxiang, and Quanshi. When using different sensors, only the corresponding communication protocol needs to be loaded.

Hardware Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using the laser sensor, it needs to be installed in a suitable position. Connect the laser sensor's network cable directly or through a switch to any RJ45 interface on the robot control box.

Sensor Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please ensure your laser sensor and welding torch are fixedly installed on the robot end flange, the laser sensor is connected to the robot control box via a network cable, and the IP addresses of the laser sensor and the robot control box are on the same subnet. Turn on the power for both the robot and the sensor. The figure below shows the installation of a Ruiniu laser sensor.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/140.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.8‑1 Laser Sensor Installation

In the communication configuration section, enter the sensor's IP address and port number, click the "Configure" button. The sampling period defaults to 25, select "Laser Plane Coordinate System" for the coordinate system, choose the corresponding communication protocol according to your sensor model, and click the "Load" button.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/141.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.8‑2 Laser Sensor Configuration

In the "Tracking Sensor Test" section, click "Open" and then "Close" the sensor sequentially, observing whether the sensor's laser turns on or off. If the laser turns on and off normally, it indicates that communication has been successfully established between the robot and the sensor. Otherwise, please check if parameters such as the IP address and port number are correct, and if the network connection between the sensor and the robot is proper.

Sensor Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using the laser sensor, it needs to be calibrated. The calibration accuracy directly affects the tracking accuracy of the laser sensor. Calibration methods for the laser sensor include the Five-Point Method, Six-Point Method, and Eight-Point Method. Taking the most commonly used Five-Point Method in welding applications as an example, the calibration principle is to first point the tool (welding torch) to a fixed calibration point (as shown in Figure 4), and then have the laser sensor irradiate and recognize this point from four different poses.

.. note::
  This calibration point must be accurately recognizable by the laser sensor; otherwise, precise calibration cannot be achieved.

Then, the sensor coordinate pose is calculated. The calibration process is described in detail below:

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/143.png

   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.8‑4 Laser Sensor Calibration Point

**Step1**: Open the robot WebApp, navigate to "Initial" -> "Basic" -> "Tool Coordinate" to enter the Tool Coordinate System interface. Select an unused tool coordinate system, click to modify its name to "Welding Torch", set the tool type to "Tool", and the installation location to "End Flange".

Laser Seam Finding + Tracking
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The collaborative robot, working with the laser sensor, requires the following steps to complete the laser seam finding + laser tracking function:

(1) The robot moves to a point outside the weld seam;
(2) Start laser seam finding, and the robot moves towards the weld seam position carrying the laser sensor;
(3) The laser sensor identifies the weld seam, and the robot moves the welding torch to the identified weld seam start point;
(4) Laser tracking begins, and simultaneously the robot moves towards the weld seam end point, with the laser sensor recording the position in real time during the movement;
(5) The welding torch moves along the positions recorded by the laser sensor, achieving the tracking effect.

Before debugging seam finding and tracking, please ensure the sensor is correctly installed, the "Welding Torch" tool coordinate system is correctly calibrated, and the laser sensor is also correctly calibrated. Assuming the green line in the figure is the weld seam to be welded, to make the robot automatically find the welding start point A and automatically weld to point B, the following instructions need to be written:

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/158.png

Writing Seam Finding Instructions
****************************************************************

Create a new user program "laserTrack.lua", select "Welding Instructions". Click "Laser Tracking", and the laser tracking instruction addition page will pop up.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/159.png
   :align: center
   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 8.8‑23 Laser Tracking Instruction

Find the "Seam Finding Command", select the coordinate system name as "Laser Sensor", direction select "+x" indicating the robot carrying the laser sensor moves from the current position along the "+x" direction of the "Welding Torch" coordinate system while searching for the weld seam. "Speed" is the moving speed for the laser sensor seam finding, Length is the maximum seam finding length for the laser sensor. If the robot exceeds this length without finding the weld seam, it will report an error. Maximum Seam Finding Time is similar to the length; if this time is exceeded without finding the weld seam, the robot reports an error. Please input the above parameters correctly according to the actual scenario. Click the "Seam Finding Start" and "Seam Finding End" instructions sequentially, and click the "Apply" button.

Writing Instruction to Move to Seam Finding Point
***********************************************************************

Add a Linear (LIN) point-to-point motion instruction, with the target point being "seamPos", which is the laser sensor seam finding point.

.. note:: The "seamPos" point is an internal point in the robot system dedicated for laser sensor seam finding. There is no need to teach this point manually; after laser sensor seam finding, the seam finding point information is automatically stored in the "seamPos" point.

Offset can be set for the seam finding point. The offset type can be "Base Coordinate System Offset", "Tool Coordinate System Offset", or "Laser Raw Data Offset".

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/162.png
   :align: center
   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 8.8‑26 Seam Finding Offset Options

When the seam finding offset function is enabled, offset parameters can be set. "dx" represents the offset distance along the x-direction of the selected coordinate system, "drx" represents the rotation angle around the x-axis of the selected coordinate system. Click the "Add" button, then click the "Apply" button.

Writing Seam Finding Start Point and Tracking End Point Instructions
************************************************************************************************

Before starting laser seam finding, a seam finding start point needs to be specified. The robot first moves to the seam finding start point, then performs seam finding along a certain direction and speed. Teach the seam finding start point "seamStartPt" near where the laser sensor beam is close to the weld seam start point A. Pay attention to matching the seam finding start point with the seam finding direction to ensure the robot can find the weld seam position within the set distance and maximum seam finding time.

Execute the above program. The robot will carry the laser sensor to start the seam finding movement from the seam finding start point. After finding the weld seam, the robot immediately moves to the weld seam start point and executes the arc starting operation. After successful arc starting, the robot moves towards the weld seam end point and tracks the weld seam trajectory during the movement. The robot stops welding upon reaching the weld seam end point.

Laser Trajectory Recording + Trajectory Replay
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The workflow for laser trajectory recording + trajectory replay is:

(1) The robot carries the laser sensor to move along a segment of the weld seam, and the laser sensor records the weld seam position trajectory data in real time during the movement;
(2) After the trajectory recording is completed, the robot moves to the starting point of the recorded trajectory;
(3) The robot performs trajectory replay motion along the trajectory recorded by the laser sensor.

Array Suction Cups
----------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing array suction cups on the robot end can help quickly deploy material grasping workstations for different scenarios. The number and layout of suction cups can be customized for materials of different sizes and shapes, improving work efficiency and stability.

The collaborative robot supports an array of up to 20 suction cups. Individual suction cups can be controlled for grasping and releasing, or the entire connected array can be controlled to act synchronously. Each suction cup supports configuration of station numbers from 1 to 20, configured based on DynamicLAB software.

Hardware Description
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The collaborative robot communicates with and controls the suction cup array via an Ethernet to 485 module. The WebApp generates the communication protocol for the array suction cups. The protocol sends control data to the Ethernet to 485 module via TCP/IP. The module then sends the received control data to each suction cup via 485, thus achieving control of the array suction cups (the control data format is ModbusRTU protocol format).

The Ethernet to 485 module acts as the server for Ethernet communication and the master for 485 communication. Each suction cup in the array is a 485 communication slave station, and each suction cup should be configured with a different slave station number.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/202.png
   :align: center
   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-1 Collaborative Robot Suction Cup Array Gripper Application

The Ethernet to 485 module usually has two TCP Server ports corresponding to multiple 485 slave ports. Taking CH9121 as an example, its TCP Server port 1 corresponds to 485 slave ports 1-10, and TCP Server port 2 corresponds to 485 slave ports 11-20. The robot establishes two TCP communications with the Ethernet to 485 module, ultimately controlling 20 suction cups respectively.

The aforementioned Ethernet to 485 module needs to be configured as follows:

- ① Ethernet end configured as TCP Server, IP address: 192.168.58.10, Port 1 number: 50001, Port 2 number: 50002;
- ② 485 end configured with baud rate 115200, data bits 8, stop bits 1, no parity. The Ethernet to 485 module usually comes with a debugging software where the above configuration can be performed. The following figure shows the configuration tool page for the CH9121 model Ethernet to 485 module:

Function Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the WebApp, click sequentially "Initial" -> "Peripherals" -> "Array Suction Cups"; The control modes for array suction cups are Unicast Mode and Broadcast Mode:

**Unicast Mode**: The communication protocol includes control content for each suction cup, allowing independent control of each suction cup in the array.

**Broadcast Mode**: Generates a communication protocol for all suction cups in the array, allowing synchronous control of grasping and releasing for all suction cups in the array, but cannot control a single suction cup individually.

Depending on the actual scenario, you can configure only Unicast Mode, or configure both modes simultaneously (allowing both individual control of specific suction cups and synchronous control of all suction cups).

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/204.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-3 Array Suction Cup Control Mode

Unicast Mode Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open the WebApp, click sequentially "Initial" -> "Peripherals" -> "Array Suction Cups" -> "Unicast Mode". There are two methods for configuring the Unicast Mode protocol: "Auto Configuration" and "Manual Configuration":

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/205.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-4 Unicast Configuration Mode

**Auto Configuration**: Upload an existing protocol file directly to the robot controller. The existing protocol file may come from: ① Downloaded from another robot that has already configured and debugged the array suction cups; ② Written by technical personnel according to the actual scenario (users writing protocol files can achieve more flexible and efficient suction cup control). If multiple devices use the same array suction cups, using Auto Configuration to directly upload the protocol can improve deployment speed.

**Manual Configuration**: Configure the communication protocol for each suction cup according to the slave ID and vacuum level of the suction cups in the array. The manual configuration steps are as follows:

Select slave station number 1, input the maximum vacuum, minimum vacuum, grasp timeout time (timeout is not yet open), and click the "Configure" button. At this time, a suction cup protocol with protocol number 1 appears in the "Device Operation and Status" column, and the "Manual Configuration" and "Slave Station Number" labels will display all currently configured slave station numbers.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/206.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-5 Configuring Unicast Suction Cup

Repeat the above steps to configure suction cups for multiple slave station numbers as needed. Each time a suction cup is configured, the robot system automatically updates the suction cup communication protocol content corresponding to "Protocol Number: 1", supporting up to 20 suction cups. After all suction cups are configured, click the "Connect" button in the "Protocol Number 1" box. The communication between the robot and the suction cups starts running, and the "Run Status" indicator lights up (Note: Please complete the configuration of all slave station number suction cups first, then click the "Connect" button. Configuring suction cup slaves after communication is established is invalid).

After the communication between the robot and the suction cups is successfully established, a list of operation boxes for all configured suction cup slave stations appears in the "Device Operation and Status" column; In the operation box page corresponding to each slave station number suction cup, suction cup control and status monitoring can be performed (including "Suction Status", "Current Vacuum", "Suction Cup Pressure", etc.). The suction cup slave station IDs configured in the figure below are 2 and 11 respectively.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/207.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-6 Unicast Suction Cup Connection

Click the "Suction" button in the upper right corner of the control box for slave station number 1 suction cup, and the suction cup will execute the "Set Vacuum Suction" action. At this time, the "Suction" button becomes the "Release" button. Click this button again, and the suction cup will execute the release action. When the suction cup performs the above actions, the corresponding status items such as "Suction Status" and "Current Vacuum" will display the suction cup's status in real time.

.. note:: Note: After configuring the suction cup protocol and completing the connection, you need to click the "Suction" button once to activate the suction cup. This can also test whether the communication between the robot and the suction cup is normal.

If the connection between the robot and the suction cup fails, the suction cup control box will not be displayed, and the run status indicator in "Protocol Number: 1" will be off.

.. note:: Note: If the physical communication connection between the suction cup and the Ethernet to 485 module is disconnected and then reconnected during use, it may cause the protocol to fail to establish a connection. In this case, you can unplug and replug the network cable of the Ethernet to 485 module and try to connect again.

Unicast Mode Protocol Download
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Click the "Download" button in "Manual Configuration" to download the suction cup protocol to the local computer. The suction cup protocol is a cyclically executed LUA program. The program executes the following steps in each cycle:

- ① Read suction cup control data from the robot;
- ② Write control data to the suction cup via socket;
- ③ Read status data from the suction cup via socket;
- ④ Feedback suction cup status data to the robot;

The suction cup communication protocol cyclically executes to achieve communication control between the robot and the suction cups. In the communication protocol, users can customize the cycle period, control data register address, and status data register address, and can modify the protocol content according to the actual situation. The following is a suction cup communication protocol code example:

Broadcast Mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The collaborative robot can control all connected suction cups to act simultaneously through Broadcast Mode.

.. note:: Note: Unicast Mode must be configured first before configuring Broadcast Mode.

Open the WebApp, click sequentially "Initial" -> "Peripherals" -> "Array Suction Cups", first complete the configuration of all required suction cup slave stations in Unicast Mode (configure only, do not establish communication protocol connection).

Click "Broadcast Mode", input the "Maximum Vacuum", "Minimum Vacuum", "Grasp Timeout Time" (timeout is not yet open) for the suction cups in the "Parameter Configuration", and click the "Configure" button. At this time, the broadcast mode communication protocol appears in the "Device Operation and Status" box. In broadcast mode, setting the vacuum parameters takes effect for every connected suction cup.

Suction Cup Control Instruction Addition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Writing suction cup control instructions in the LUA program allows for suction control and release control of the suction cups. Unicast Mode and Broadcast Mode controls have different logical effects.

Unicast Mode Control Instruction Addition
***********************************************************

Unicast Mode control can control single or multiple suction cups based on the starting slave station address and quantity, and can set different control states for each suction cup.

In the suction cup instruction addition page, click "Suction Cup Control Instruction", select the control mode as "Unicast Mode", input the slave station number as 1, the write quantity as 2, and the suction states as "1,2". Click the "Add" button to add a Unicast Mode suction cup control instruction in the "Program Preview".

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/213.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-12 Add Suction Cup Control Instruction

The meanings of the parameters in the suction cup control instruction are as follows:

- **Slave Station Number**: The starting slave station number for Unicast Mode control of suction cups.
- **Write Quantity**: The number of suction cups to control starting from the starting slave station number in Unicast Mode.
- **Suction States**: In Unicast Mode, starting from the starting slave station number, the control state flag for each suction cup (1-Suction at max vacuum; 2-Suction at set vacuum, i.e., suction cup vacuum maintained between max and min vacuum; 3-Stop suction); The control state flags for each suction cup are separated by ",", and the number of control flags must match the number of suction cups to be controlled; If you want to control two suction cups, with control operations being "Suction at max vacuum" and "Suction at set vacuum" respectively, then the input for this item is "1,2".

Click the "Apply" button. At this time, a suction cup control instruction is added to the "testSucker.lua" program. Switch the robot to automatic mode and execute this LUA program. The robot will control the two suction cups with slave station numbers 1 and 2 to perform suction actions at maximum vacuum and set vacuum respectively.

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-13 Add Suction Cup Instruction in LUA Program

Adding Broadcast Mode Control Commands
***********************************************************

The suction state set by the broadcast mode control command takes effect on all currently connected suction cups.

Click "Suction Cup Control Command", select the control mode as "Broadcast Mode", and enter the suction state as 1 (suction with maximum vacuum). Click the "Add" button.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/215.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-14 Adding a Broadcast Control Command

Click the "Apply" button. At this point, a broadcast mode suction cup control command is added to the "testSucker.lua" file. Switch the robot to automatic mode and execute this program, then all connected suction cups will start the suction action with maximum vacuum.

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-15 Adding a Broadcast Control Command in the LUA Program

Adding Suction Cup Status Acquisition Command
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Click "Get Suction Cup Status", select the slave station number of the suction cup whose status you want to obtain, then click the "Add" and "Apply" buttons sequentially. This adds a command "GetSuckerState(1)" to get the suction cup status in "testSucker.lua".

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/217.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.12-16 Adding the Get Suction Cup Status Command

The GetSuckerState() command returns 3 values, as follows:

- **state**: The current state of the suction cup: 0-Object released or suction cup started successfully; 1-Workpiece detected, object adsorbed; 2-No object adsorbed; 3-Object detached.
- **pressValue**: Current vacuum/pressure value;
- **err**: Error code: 0-Normal; Others: Abnormal.

In "testSucker.lua", use three variables to receive the return values of the GetSuckerState() function. Use Lua variable queries to display the above information in the WebApp Variable Query Display Area.

Adding Wait for Suction Cup Adsorption Status Command
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In practical applications of array suction cups, it is often necessary to wait for the suction cup to complete suction (release) before executing the next action. The collaborative robot provides a command to wait for the suction cup action to complete. This command ends execution when the suction cup reaches the set state; otherwise, it blocks and waits for the suction cup action to complete within the set timeout period.

On the array suction cup command addition page, click "Wait for Suction Cup Adsorption Status", select the corresponding suction cup slave station number 1, select the control mode as "Workpiece detected, object adsorbed", and enter the timeout time as 10000ms. Click the "Add" button.

CNC Function Package Based on FOCAS (For Linux Systems Only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To automate the loading and unloading process in machine tool processing, a CNC function package based on FOCAS communication has been developed, enabling communication interaction and coordinated motion between the collaborative robot and the CNC machine tool.

As shown in the figure, FOCAS communication is based on Ethernet. By connecting the robot control box network port to the embedded network port of the machine tool with an Ethernet cable, FOCAS communication between the robot and the machine tool can be established, enabling CNC control and machine tool status monitoring from the robot side.

Establishing FOCAS Communication
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

FOCAS communication is based on Ethernet. It requires forming a local area network (LAN) connecting the robot, CNC machine tool, and PC to achieve physical link connection, and finally establishing FOCAS communication through the robot's open protocol.

Network Configuration
**************************************************

**Step1**: First, change the IP address of the PC to the same subnet as the robot control box. The robot control box's IP address is "192.168.58.2".

If no switch is used for networking, you can use the two built-in network ports on the robot control box for networking. The operation is as follows: Log in to the robot's WebAPP, go to System Settings -> General Settings -> Network Settings, set the IP address of Port 0 to: 192.168.58.2; set the IP address of Port 1 to 192.168.57.2. Simultaneously, set WebAPP to use Port 0 and WebRecovery to use Port 1, as shown in the figure. After completing all settings, click Set Network.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/222.png
   :align: center
   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 8.13‑2 Robot Network Configuration Diagram

**Step2**: Then restart the control box and connect it to the PC via the Port 0 network port, then log in to the robot WebApp. Also, configure the IP address of the CNC machine tool that needs communication to be in the same subnet as the PC and the robot control box, i.e., 192.168.58.xx, and change the machine tool's port to 8193. This completes all network configuration.

Open Protocol File Configuration
**************************************************

**Step1**: Then proceed with the peripheral open protocol configuration. First, you need to create a new lua file named starting with `CtrlDev_CNC` as the open protocol file for establishing FOCAS communication, such as `CtrlDev_CNC_demo.lua`.

This file needs to set the Open Protocol ID and use the `CNCComSet` function to establish or disconnect the connection with the CNC. The parameter descriptions for the `CNCComSet` function are shown in the table below. Example code is as follows.

.. centered:: Table 8.13-2 CNCComSet Function Parameter Description Table

    :linenos:

    local id = 1      --Open LUA Protocol ID
    --FOCAS Disconnect
    CNCComSet(1, 1001, '192.168.57.100', 8193)
    sleep_ms(1000)
    --FOCAS Establish Connection
    CNCComSet(1, 1, '192.168.57.100', 8193)
    sleep_ms(1000)
    while(1) do
    sleep_ms(5000)
    end

**Step2**: After writing the open protocol lua file, select the just-created `CtrlDev_CNC_fanuc.lua` file and upload it. Select the ID set in the file, choose the uploaded open protocol file from the dropdown, and click Configure.

Virtual Wall Configuration Based on Force Sensor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The virtual wall function based on the force sensor allows setting virtual walls to limit the robot's workspace and avoid direct collision contact.

Force Sensor Installation and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step1**: Taking the "Kunwei" sensor as an example, during installation, the coordinate system direction of the force sensor must be consistent with the end flange coordinate system, as shown in Figure 1 (In Figure 1, red indicates the X+ direction of the end flange coordinate system, green indicates the Y+ direction, and blue indicates the Z+ direction);

.. centered:: Figure 8.14‑1 Force Sensor Installation

**Step2**: Under the "Initial" -> "Peripherals" -> "Force Sensor" menu bar, click "Adapted Devices" to enter the force sensor device configuration interface.

The force sensor configuration information includes manufacturer, type, software version, and mounting location. Users can configure the corresponding force sensor information according to specific production needs. If users need to change the configuration, they can first select the corresponding number, click the "Clear" button to clear the corresponding information, and reconfigure according to requirements; the specific operation is shown in the figure.

**Step3**: Select the configured force sensor number, click the "Reset" button. After the page pops up indicating the command was sent successfully, click the "Activate" button. Check the activation status in the force sensor information table to determine if activation was successful. Additionally, the force sensor will have initial values. Users can choose "Zero Calibration" and "Remove Zero" according to usage needs. Force sensor zero calibration requires ensuring the force sensor is level and vertically downward, and the robot has no configured load.

Virtual Wall Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the force sensor for assisted dragging, a dragging handle needs to be installed under the force sensor, and a tool coordinate system needs to be configured. The specific operation is shown in Figure 4. At this point, the method for detecting the interference zone uses the set tool coordinate system position as a reference; if not set, the end flange is used as the reference.

**Step1**: Under the "Initial" -> "Safety" -> "Interference Zone" menu bar, click "Single" to enter the interference zone configuration function interface;

**Step2**: It is necessary to configure the interference method and the operation upon entering the interference zone; click "Cube Interference" to enter the configuration interface, set the operation upon entering the interference zone during dragging to "Do Not Restrict Dragging", and the operation upon entering during motion can be set as needed;

**Step3**: According to requirements, the parameter configuration can be modified. The detection method is divided into two types: "Command Position" and "Feedback Position". The interference zone mode is divided into two types: "Interference Within Range" and "Interference Outside Range". The reference coordinate system is selected as "Base Coordinate". Set according to actual use. Detailed operations are shown in the figure;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The six-axis force and joint impedance hybrid dragging function utilizes the force sensor to perceive external forces, allowing the robot to perform assisted dragging in drag mode. Different dragging experiences can be achieved by adjusting the gain coefficients. Joint impedance uses impedance control to limit the drag force.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Force Sensor Installation Configuration

For detailed operations on force sensor installation configuration, refer to the section above: Virtual Wall Configuration Based on Force Sensor.

2. Force Sensor Zeroing

To facilitate dragging the robot, a drag handle needs to be installed below the sensor, as shown in Figure 1.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/239.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.14‑11 Drag Handle

**Step1**: Set the tool coordinate system according to the actual handle length, as shown in Figure 2.

**Step2**: Under the "Initial" -> "Basic" -> "Load" menu, click "Sensor" to enter the Force/Torque Sensor Load interface.

Using the drag button, adjust the robot end effector to face horizontally downwards. Then, click "Load" -> "Sensor Identification" to enter the interface, find the "Record Initial Position" button in the "Sensor Auto Zeroing" section. Then, switch the robot mode to automatic mode and click the "Auto Zero" button. After the program finishes running, the sensor zeroing is complete. Detailed operations are shown in the figures.

Six-Axis Force and Joint Impedance Hybrid Dragging
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Assisted Dragging

**Step1**: Under the "Application" -> "Tool App" menu, click "Drag Lock" to enter the drag lock function interface.

**Step2**: In the "Six-Axis Force and Joint Impedance Hybrid Dragging" section, set the Control Status to "On", the Impedance Enable Status to "Off", set the Drag Gain, the End Linear Speed to 1000 mm/s, the Angular Speed Limit to 100 °/s, then click the "Apply" button to enable the function. The specific configuration is shown in Figure 4.

**Step3**: Switch the robot mode to drag mode to drag the robot. The specific effect is: dragging the robot end effector feels easy and provides a good experience; dragging the robot joints feels heavy.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/241.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.14‑14 Configuration Parameters for Six-Axis Force Assisted Dragging

2. Joint Impedance Control

The role of impedance control is to limit the drag force and drag position. Its default status is "Off".

The specific operation is shown in Figure 5. Set the Impedance Enable Status to "On", then set the Damping Coefficient and Stiffness Coefficient as shown in Figure 5. The function of the Stiffness Coefficient is currently not available.

.. figure:: robot_peripherals/242.png
   :align: center
   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.14‑15 Configuration Parameters for Joint Impedance

Specific functions of the parameters:

- **Control Status**: After enabling, this function can be used in drag mode.

- **Impedance Enable**: After enabling, stiffness and damping parameters need to be configured. Its role is to limit the drag force and drag position.

- **Drag Gain**: Recommended parameter range [0-5]. Setting the parameter to 0 makes the robot undraggable. Setting to 1 shows no improvement in dragging effect. Setting greater than 1 makes dragging light and provides a good experience. The larger the parameter, the easier the dragging.

- **Stiffness Gain**: Set to 0. Its role is to return to the initial position before dragging after dragging.

- **Damping Gain**: Its role is to limit the drag force. Parameter range for axes 1-3 is [0-0.5], for axes 4-5 is [0-0.1]; for axis 6 it is [0-0.05].

- **End Linear Speed**: 1000 mm/s. When the end linear speed limit is exceeded, the robot switches mode to manual mode and prompts TCP overspeed.

- **Angular Speed Limit**: 100 °/s. When the angular speed limit is exceeded, the robot switches mode to manual mode and prompts TCP overspeed.

Synchronized Laser Tracking of Extended Axis and Robot
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Laser Data with Transformation Method
****************************************************

Synchronized laser tracking of the extended axis and robot in the base coordinate system does not require external axis calibration. Other function settings and composition are consistent with synchronized tracking in the extended axis coordinate system.

First, configure the laser tracking data, setting the laser tracker data to the type with transformation.

After the robot finishes recording the movement trajectory of the weld seam during the extended axis motion in place, the extended axis can be returned to the welding start point to prepare for synchronized tracking welding.

At the beginning of welding, the welding torch needs to be moved to the starting point position of the laser sensor recorded data. Add the Move to Welding Point instruction:

In the "Laser Tracking" page, select the "Data Record" -> "Trajectory Replay" instruction, click "Add" and apply. In the instruction, the waiting time defaults to 0ms, and the speed is the ratio of the replay speed to the recording speed, recommended to be greater than 50%.

Adding an extended axis motion instruction after the "Trajectory Replay" instruction enables synchronized motion of the extended axis and robot laser tracking.

The following is a typical LUA program for extended axis with laser data transformation point tracking:

   :width: 4in

.. centered:: Figure 8.15‑18 Example Program for Extended Axis with Laser Data Transformation Point Tracking

The robot executes the "record first, then replay" process. It first records the changing trajectory of the workpiece weld seam during extended axis motion, and then during welding, the extended axis and trajectory replay are executed synchronously.

Laser Data without Transformation Method
****************************************************

Using the laser data without transformation method for point tracking does not require calibration of the extended axis coordinate system.

Set the laser tracking sensor data to the type without transformation.

In the "Laser Record" page, select the "Record While Replaying" instruction, click "Add" and apply. In the instruction, you can choose "Delay Time" or "Delay Distance" (distance is recommended). The compensation sensitivity coefficient is adjusted according to the actual sensor laser data; a lower value means lower adjustment sensitivity and better anti-interference. The replay speed defaults to 100%.

Adding an extended axis motion instruction after the "Record While Replaying" instruction enables synchronized motion of the extended axis and robot laser tracking.

The following is a typical LUA program for extended axis with laser data without transformation point tracking:

After aligning the welding torch with the offset from the front-mounted laser, the robot's extended axis moves and executes the "record while replaying" process. The front-mounted laser tracker first records the changing trajectory of the workpiece weld seam during extended axis motion, and then adjusts at the welding torch after the set delay distance or time.

DARU DFC Force Control Polishing Head Application
-----------------------------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing the DFC polishing head on the robot end-effector helps the robot quickly deploy grinding, polishing, and deburring tasks in different scenarios. It allows customizing the force control magnitude for workpieces of different sizes and shapes, improving the precision and effectiveness of grinding work.

Hardware Description
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The collaborative robot communicates with and controls the DARU DFC polishing head via Ethernet. The WebApp generates the DARU DFC polishing head communication protocol, which sends control data to the DARU force control controller module via TCP/IP. The module then sends the received control data to the DFC force control actuator, thereby achieving control of the polishing head. The force control controller module acts as the server for Ethernet communication and can connect to polishing head actuators on two channels.

.. centered:: Figure 8.17‑1 Collaborative Robot DARU DFC Polishing Head Application

The force control controller module requires the following configuration: Ethernet port configured with IP address: 192.168.58.88, port number: 2000.

Function Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the WebApp, click sequentially on "Initial Setup", "Peripherals", "Polishing". The control types for the polishing head are Pre-adapted Devices and Peripheral Open Protocol:
Pre-adapted Devices: Automatically generates and loads the open protocol for adapted polishing head device types, no user programming required.
Peripheral Open Protocol: Users write the open protocol for the polishing head to be adapted using Lua to achieve communication control.

.. centered:: Figure 8.17‑2 Polishing Control Types

Pre-adapted Device Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open the WebApp, click sequentially on "Initial Setup", "Peripherals", "Polishing Head", "Pre-adapted Devices". In the device status, select "DARU DFC Polishing Head" for the type, then click "Configure". This will automatically load the embedded peripheral open protocol "CtrlDev_DARUDFCPOLISH.lua".

   :width: 6in

.. centered:: Figure 8.17‑3 DARU DFC Device Peripheral Open Protocol Auto-loading

With the hardware connection confirmed correct, the open protocol can be started. When the run status is green and the communication status feedback in the Polish status on the right shows "Connection Established", it indicates successful communication between the robot and the polishing head controller. Parameters can then be configured to set the polishing head channel for force control and the set force value. The open protocol will cyclically send the set value, channel, and the robot's current rx, ry, rz to the polishing head, as shown in Figure 2-3. Additionally, the Polish status feedback will also display the current force feedback value and force limit warning from the polishing head in real-time. When a warning occurs, an alarm reminder will also appear in the upper right corner of the page, as shown in Figure 2-4.

Peripheral Open Protocol Download
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Click the "Download" button in "Peripheral Open Protocol" to download the protocol to the local computer. The peripheral open protocol is a cyclically executed LUA program. In each cycle, the program performs the following steps:

① Read control data for the DFC polishing head from the robot;

② Write control data to the DFC polishing head via socket;

③ Read status data from the DFC polishing head via socket;

④ Feedback DFC polishing head status data to the robot;

The communication protocol executes cyclically to achieve communication control between the robot and the polishing head. Within the communication protocol, users can customize the cycle period, the server port to connect to, and the IP address.

Below is a sample communication protocol code for the DARU DFC polishing head:

.. code-block:: 
    :linenos:

    local id = 1 
    local ctrlValues = {0,0, 0,0, 0,0, 0,0}
    local realTimeState = {0,0, 0,0, 0,0, 0,0}
    socket1 = TCPClientConnect('192.168.58.88', 2000, 500, 10, 2, 3)
    sleepCnt = 100
    while(sleepCnt > 0) do
        local stopFlag = GetOpenLUAStopFlag(id)
        if(stopFlag ~= 0) then 
          TCPClientDisconnect(socket1)
          setDFCPolishRealtimeState(0, 0, 0)
          break
        end 
      sleepCnt = sleepCnt -1
      sleep_ms(50)
    end
    local cnt = 5
    while(1) do
        channel, force = getDFCPolishSet()
        comState, sendBuff = DFCPolishInput(socket1, channel, force)
        sleep_ms(50)

        byte, error, forceFeedback = DFCPolishOutput(socket1)
        setDFCPolishRealtimeState(comState, error, forceFeedback)
        sleep_ms(50)

      if(comState == 0) then
          TCPClientDisconnect(socket1)
          while(cnt > 0) do
            socket1 = TCPClientConnect('192.168.58.88', 2000, 500, 10, 2, 3)
            cnt = cnt - 1
            if(socket1 > 0)then
              break
            end
          end
      end

        local stopFlag = GetOpenLUAStopFlag(id)
        if(stopFlag ~= 0 or cnt == 0) then 
          TCPClientDisconnect(socket1)
          setDFCPolishRealtimeState(0, 0, 0)
          break
        end    
    end

.. centered:: Figure 8.17‑9 Add Get Polishing Head Status Instruction

The GetDFCState() instruction returns 2 values, as follows:

**DFCwarn**: Force control limit exceeded warning 0-Normal 1-Alarm;

**force**: Force feedback value.

In "testDFC.lua", use three variables to receive the return values of the GetDFCState() function. Use Lua variable query to display the above information in the WebApp variable query display area.
