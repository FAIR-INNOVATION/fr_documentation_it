Joint Jog
++++++++++++++++

Under Joint operation, the 6 slider bars in the middle represent the angles of the corresponding axes respectively, and the joint movement is divided into single-axis inching and multi-axis linkage

**single axis jog**:The user can control the movement of the robot by operating the left and right circular buttons, as shown in figure below. In the manual mode and the joint coordinate system, perform a rotation operation on a joint of the robot. When the robot stops beyond the range of motion (soft limit), you can use single-axis jogging for manual operation to move the robot out of the overrun position. Single-axis jogging is faster and more convenient than other operation modes for rough positioning and large-scale movement.

Teaching point record
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The manual teaching control area is mainly to set the test coordinate system in the teaching mode, and display the angle and coordinate values of each axis of the robot in real time, and can name and save the teaching points.

When saving a teaching point, the coordinate system of the teaching point is the coordinate system of the current robot application. 

There are two ways to record teaching points: "quick point recording" and "named point recording".

- Quick point recording: teaching points are automatically recorded and names are automatically generated;
- Naming points: Customized naming of teaching points, consisting of teaching point prefix+teaching point name;

For the sensor teaching point, select the calibrated sensor type tool, enter the point name, click Add, and the saved point position is the position recognized by the sensor.

   When switching to the drag mode from the interface, first confirm whether the end tool load and the center of mass are set correctly, and whether the friction compensation coefficient is set reasonably, then press and hold the end button to confirm whether the drag is normal, and then switch to the drag mode from the interface after confirming that it is correct.

- **Step4 Start recording**:Click the "Start" button to start track recording, and drag the robot to teach actions. In addition, there is a "TPD recording start/stop" function configuration item in the terminal DI configuration. By configuring this function, the user can trigger the "start recording" trace function through an external signal. It should be noted that to start recording a trace through an external signal, first Configure the TPD track information on the page first.

- **Step5 Stop recording**:After the action teaching is completed, click the "Stop" button to stop the track recording, and then drag the teaching switch button to make the robot exit the drag teaching mode. When the teach pendant receives "stop track recording successful", it means the track recording is successful. Same as step 4, after configuring the "TPD recording start/stop" function, you can trigger the recording to stop by an external signal.

- **Step6 Teach programming**:Click New, select a blank template, click to enter the PTP function programming item, select the initial position point just saved, click the "Add" button, after the application is completed, a PTP instruction will be displayed in the program file; then click to enter the TPD function programming item, Select the track just recorded, set whether it is smooth and the speed scaling, click the "Add" button, after the application is completed, a MoveTPD instruction will be displayed in the program file;

- **Step7 Trajectory recurrence**:After editing the teaching program, switch to the automatic operation mode, click the "start running" icon on the top of the interface to start running the program, and the robot will start to reproduce the teaching action.

- **Step8 track edit**:The TPD track editing area can visually display and edit the track to achieve pre-analysis and streamlining of the TPD track. Select the corresponding track acquisition point, then the track points recorded by the user will be displayed in the three-dimensional space of the robot, and then the user can drag the "Start" and "End" scroll bars to simulate and reproduce and edit the start and end points of the track.

TPD file deletion and exception handling:

- **Trajectory file deletion**:Click to enter the TPD function item, select the track file to be deleted, and click the "Delete Track" button. If the deletion is successful, you will receive a successful deletion prompt.

- **Exception handling:**

  +  **Command points exceeded**:A track can record up to 20,000 points. When the number exceeds 20,000 points, the controller will no longer record the exceeded points, and will send a warning to the teach pendant that the number of command points exceeds the limit. At this time, you need to click to stop recording;

  +  **TPD instruction interval is too large**:If the teaching pendant reports an error that the TPD command interval is too large, check whether the robot has returned to the initial position before recording. If the robot returns to the initial position and still reports an error that the TPD command interval is too large, delete the current track and record a new one;

  +  If other abnormal conditions occur during TPD operation, the robot operation should be stopped immediately through the teach pendant or the emergency stop button to check the cause.

.. important:: 
   During the operation of the TPD function, you should strictly follow the corresponding prompts on the teach pendant.
