LIN command joint	overspeed processing function
*****************************************************************

When using the Cartesian space linear motion command LIN, the constrained condition is the linear velocity, but the actual operation is affected by the workspace, and the angular velocity of the joint may have exceeded the limit when the linear velocity requirement is met. This function implements an optional handling strategy to deal with joint overspeed during LIN movements.

**Step1**: Click the Linear Motion Command button;

Angular velocity adjustable function
**********************************************

This function can be used when encountering a workpiece that requires corner welding during the welding process, or when a specific linear line is planned (a quick transition is required when the attitude change is large and the position change is small, but the linear speed cannot be accelerated).

**Step1**:Set the tool coordinate system to calibrate the tool size and attitude of the welding gun.

.. note:: The values on the interface are examples only, and the actual tool status shall prevail.

   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.5-3-10 Add a transition point linear motion command

**Step5**:The robot completes the attitude transition at the starting point, normally executes the linear command movement to the end point of the section, closes the "The transition point angular velocity is adjustable" button, and adds a termination waypoint.

.. image:: coding/251.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.5-3-12 Generate a straight LUA instruction with transition points

A complete set of corner wrapping welds usually has more than one transition point, and in the case of corner wrapping shown in Figure 7, there are two attitude transition points with small position change and large attitude change during the welding process. 

Point 1 is the starting point of the first section of welding, and point 2 is the end point of the first section of welding; 

Point 3 is the starting point of the second section of welding, and point 4 is the end point of the second section of welding; 

Point 5 is the starting point of the third section of welding, and point 6 is the end point of the third section of welding. 

The attitude transition occurs from the end point of the previous section of welding to the starting point of the next section of welding, so it is necessary to add the attitude angular velocity adjustment instruction at the starting point of the next section of welding, so that the maximum linear velocity remains unchanged during the transition of the wrapping angle attitude, and the maximum angular velocity is increased, so that the process of wrapping angle welding process runs.

Arc command
++++++++++++++++

Click the "Arc" icon to enter the Arc command editing interface.

The "Arc" command is an arc motion, which includes three points. The first point is the starting point of the arc, the second point is the middle transition point of the arc, and the third point is the end point.

Both the transition point and the end point can be set to offset, and you can choose to base coordinate system offset Shift and offset based on tool coordinates, and pop up x, y, z, rx, ry, rz offset settings, and the end point can set a smooth transition radius to achieve continuous motion effect.

.. important::
   For circular motion, you need to add PTP or Lin command to move to the starting point first.

Circle command
++++++++++++++++

Click the "Circle" icon to enter the Circle command editing interface.

The cooperative robot can carry out the circle trajectory movement by adding the circle command. Before adding the circle command, it is necessary to teach three path points on the circle trajectory. Suppose that the three path points on the circle trajectory are "P1", "P2" and "P3" respectively, where "P1" is the starting point of the circle trajectory, "P2" and "P3" are the middle point 1 and 2 of the circle trajectory.Move the robot to the above three points and add the names of the teaching points as "P1", "P2" and "P3" respectively.

.. important::
   For full circle trajectory motion, you need to add PTP or Lin command to move to the starting point first.

Switch the robot to automatic mode, start the program on the premise of ensuring safety, and the robot will move according to the circle trajectory shown in Figure 1.

Circle trajectory offset
**********************************************

The circular motion of the cooperative robot supports the offset of the positions of the middle point 1 and the middle point 2 of the circular trajectory, and the offset types include the following two types:

**The middle points of the two trajectories of the circle have the same offset:** the middle point 1 (P2) and the middle point 2 (P3) of the circle are offset by the same offset ∆(dx, dy, dz, drx, dry, drz).

**The middle points of the two trajectories of the circle have different offsets:** the middle point 1 (P2) and the middle point 2 (P3) of the circle adopt two different offsets ∆1 (dx1, dy1, dz1, drx1, dry1, drz1) and ∆2 (dx2, dy2, dz2, drx2, dry2, drz2) respectively.

The following demonstrates the usage of "same offset" and "different offset" respectively.

(1) Same offset

Open the circle command addition page, select "Same Offset" for Offset Type, and also select the starting point motion mode and starting point as "P1", and the middle point 1 of the full circle as "P2".

Changes in segment welding motion trajectory and attitude
************************************************************

The segment welding mode of the collaborative robot can be selected for the segment welding movement. The mode types include the following two types;

**No change in posture**:The robot always maintains the posture of the starting point of the welding trajectory during the welding trajectory.

**Changing posture**:During the welding trajectory process, the robot calculates the Cartesian pose and joint position of each segment of the trajectory, and changes its posture during the segment welding operation.

The following demonstrates the usage of "no change posture" and "change posture" respectively.

1. Do not change posture

Robot arc tracking system composition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

During arc tracking welding, the welding machine feeds the real-time welding current signal to PLC, and then the PLC feeds back to the robot through UDP communication. The robot can compensate the welding trajectory position according to the real-time feedback welding current value to achieve arc tracking effect. There are two ways to feedback the current signal between the welding machine and the PLC:

①CANopen or other bus communication: If your welder supports CANopen, EtherCAT, ModbusTCP and other bus communication protocols (such as MEGMEET A2 series, etc.), the PLC and the welder can communicate data directly through the relevant communication protocols, and the corresponding welding current signal can be directly transmitted to the PLC through communication. The PLC then feeds back to the robot through UDP communication.

②Analog IO: PLC can also directly collect the analog signal, and then convert the analog signal into the current value with a certain conversion relationship to feed back to the robot; If your welding machine has a real-time welding current analog output channel, you can directly connect the channel to the PLC analog input module; If your welding machine does not have a real-time welding current analog output channel, you can connect an external Hall current sensor. The sensor collects the real-time welding current signal, converts the welding current signal into an analog signal, and outputs the welding current signal to the PLC analog input module.

.. image:: coding/279.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.8-7-1 Typical arc tracing scenario

Typical scenarios for the arc tracing function include: a. welding the workpiece (the weld groove is at a right or acute angle), b. the welding gun, e. weld center line. 

The arc tracking function can tracing the welding groove through the collected welding current information and the swing parameters: c. up and down (depth) direction tracking and d. left and right (center line) direction tracking.

**2）Communication Configuration**

Open WebApp and click "Initial", "Peripheral" and "Welder" in turn.

.. image:: coding/280.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.8-7-2 Open welding config

The control type is selected as "Digital communication protocol". Since the robot communicates with PLC through UDP, UDP communication parameters need to be configured. The meanings of each parameter are as follows:

**IP address**:IP address of PLC for UDP communication;

**Port number**:PLC UDP communication port number;

**Communication cycle**:The cycle of UDP communication between the robot and the PLC, the default is 2ms;

**Packet loss detection cycle and Packet loss times**:When the number of lost packets in the packet loss detection period exceeds the specified value, the robot reports an error message indicating UDP Packet loss Exception and automatically cuts off the communication;

**Communication interruption confirmation time**:The robot does not receive a complete PLC feedback packet within this period of time, which will report "UDP communication interruption" error alarm, and cut off UDP communication;

**Automatic reconnection after communication interruption**:Whether the robot automatically reconnects after detecting UDP communication interruption;

**Reconnection period and Num of reconnections**:After automatic reconnection of UDP communication interruption is enabled and UDP communication interruption is detected, the robot reconnects at the set period. When the reconnection times reach the maximum set value and the connection is not successful, the robot reports an error alarm of "UDP communication interruption" and disconnects the UDP communication at the same time.

After configuring the above parameters, click the "Configure" and "Load" buttons successively.

**3）Arc Tracing Channel Configuration**

Click "Initial", "Base", "I/O setup" and "AI" successively, select the corresponding extended AI channel according to the actual configuration, and click "Apply" button.

.. note:: 
   The UDP communication protocol between the robot and the PLC is shown in 8.5.5.Appendix 1: UDP communication protocol for robots. In the protocol, the PLC feedback data to the robot includes four analog input channels with serial numbers 70~73, corresponding to Aux-AI0~3 in Figure 4-4; 
   
   In the welding process, PLC collects real-time welding current signals and converts them into 0~4095 numerical signals and assign them to an analog input channel (default is "Aux-AI0"). The robot side collects the corresponding analog input channel values for arc tracking operations.
   
   If you need to change the arc tracking channel to "Aux-AI1", "Aux-AI2" or "Aux-AI3", you need to update the PLC program simultaneously and assign the real-time welding current collected to the corresponding analog input port.

**7)Precautions**

1) The left-right compensated arc tracking function can only be adapted to symmetrical triangle or sine weave based on line trajectory.
2) The starting position of the welding to be able using the compensation function must be accurately above the weld (the axis of the welding gun is in the center of the fillet weld), and the welding gun should not be too close to the seam, otherwise there is a risk of hitting the welding gun.
3) The material on both sides of the groove of the workpiece needs to be consistent.
4) The coordinate size and attitude of the workpiece need to be accurately calibrated using the 6-point method.
5) If the deviation between the set trajectory and the seam is larger, the maximum compensation distance each time and the total maximum compensation distance should be larger too.
6) The deviation between the set trajectory and the end point of the weld should not be larger than 100mm/m, and too large the deviation may cause the welding wire or even the welding gun to hit the workpiece, so that the welding position deviates from the preset trajectory (the weave is not in place), resulting in the arc tracking function can not work normally.
7) If a small set current and voltage is selected for welding, the compensate coefficient of arc tracking should be reduced accordingly to reduce the instability compensation caused by the burr of the feedback current.
8)  When different coordinate systems are selected for arc tracking, the positive and negative signs of the up-down and left-right compensation coefficients may need to be adjusted, which can be judged by test welding in addition to the direction of the corresponding coordinate system. If the welding trajectory (left) is taught on an inclined plate, the welding trajectory (right) moves in the direction of descent based on the tilt gradient of the swing plane after arc tracking is enabled, and the height of the welding torch at the end is close to the starting point, then the sign of the adjustment coefficient is correct.

Modbus TCP Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ModbusTCP is a commonly used communication protocol in industrial production. Faao collaborative robots provide two ways to communicate with your device: ModbusTCP master and ModbusTCP slave.

The collaborative robot supports up to 8 ModbusTCP masters to communicate with external devices at the same time, and each master supports up to 128 registers; the collaborative robot ModbusTCP slave has 128 coils, 128 discrete inputs, 64 holding registers and 64 input registers (holding registers and input register data types include unsigned, signed and floating point types). At the same time, some ModbusTCP slave input register addresses of collaborative robots are dedicated to feedback information such as the current robot's joint position and movement speed, and some coil register addresses are dedicated to controlling the robot to start the program, stop the program, set the control box DO and other functions.

The robot ModbusTCP slave only supports establishing a connection with one master station. The robot can communicate with different devices as a master and a slave at the same time. The following is a detailed usage method.
 
ModbusTCP master
+++++++++++++++++

Before using the cooperative robot as the ModbusTCP master station to communicate with your equipment, please check the network connection between your equipment and the robot, and confirm that the network interfaces are in the same network segment.

There are several steps to use the robot ModbusTCP master station: 

- Add the master station;
- Add registers;
- Communication test;
- Writing user programs;
- Run user programs.

According to your equipment, enter the name, slave ip, port number, slave number, communication cycle, and timeout in turn. The specific meanings of the above parameters are as follows:

**Name**:ModbusTCP master station name. Robots can create up to 8 master stations to connect with corresponding slave stations. Different master stations can be distinguished by unique names, such as PLC, camera, data acquisition card and FRRobot1;

**Slave IP**:the slave IP address to which the ModbusTCP master station of the robot is connected;

.. note:: The robot and slave equipment must be connected through the network cable first, and the IP addresses of the robot and slave equipment must be in the same network segment.

**Port number**:The port number of ModbusTCP slave station to be connected;

**Slave station number**:ModbusTCP slave station number to be connected;

**Communication period**: The period (ms) when the robot ModbusTCP master station inquires about the slave station status, which only affects the update speed of the slave station register data on the ModbusTCP Settings page, but does not affect the speed of reading or writing the ModbusTCP slave station register value in the lua program of the user.

**Timeout Period**: When using the ModbusTCP read/write interface for operations, if the system fails to establish a connection after exceeding the timeout period, it will report a Modbus not connected error. Unit: ms, valid range: 100-60000.

After the above parameters are correctly input, the ModbusTCP master station of the robot automatically establishes a connection with the configured slave station. After the connection is successful, the "Connection status" indicator on the page lights up.

.. note:: 
   If you have confirmed that the relevant parameters of ModbusTCP master station are correctly configured, but the robot is not successfully connected with your equipment, please check the following configurations:
   
   ①The physical network connection between the robot and the slave equipment;

   ②The IP addresses of the two network physical ports of the robot teaching device and the control box are different, please confirm whether they are connected to the correct network port;

   ③Please confirm whether the network port of the robot and the network port of the slave station equipment are in the same network segment. If the IP address of the robot is 192.168.58.2, the IP address of the slave station equipment must be 192.168.58.0~192.168.58.255, and it cannot be the same as the IP address of the robot; 
   
   ④Check whether the port number of the slave equipment is the same as the set port number. (If the connection status indicator is flashing, it means that the register address in the master station is wrong. Please check whether the register type and address are correct)

ModbusTCP master communication test
************************************

Before the communication test, please check whether the "Cnnection status" indicator of ModbusTCP master station is always on. If the indicator is always on, it means that the current connection has been successful. 

The robot Modbus master station register has an "address value" value box for displaying the current register value, in which the registers of DI (discrete input) and AI (input register) are read-only and the corresponding address values are gray non-editable value boxes. 

When the value of the corresponding address of the slave station changes, the robot master station displays the current value synchronously corresponding to the register address value. DO (coil) and AO (holding register) are readable and writable registers, so their addresses are white editable value boxes, which can be used to read the values of the corresponding registers of ModbusTCP slave stations or modify the values of the registers on the Modbus master station setting page of the robot.

   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.18-10 Modbus master station address value

1. Numerical monitoring of DI and AI type registers of master

On the external ModbusTCP slave device, set the address value of No.255 of DI (discrete input) register to 1, change the address value of No.257 of AI (input register) to No.123, change the address value of No.258 to -123, and change the address value of No.259 to 123.3. At this time, the address value of the corresponding register on the robot Modbus master station setting page will be displayed accordingly. 

.. note:: 
   Because the register with address 259 is a floating-point register, it actually occupies two 16-bit registers 259 and 260 to store a floating-point number, so you can't set a separate register to operate the No.260 register of AI, otherwise a numerical error will occur.

The reading and writing operations of analog output (input register) and analog input (holding register) are basically the same as those of digital output (discrete input) and digital input (coil), but the difference is that the data range of the latter is only 0 or 1, while the data range of the former is larger, so the specific operations can refer to the programming of digital output and digital input, and only the reading and writing operations of analog input (Figure 82) and analog output (Figure 83) are shown here.

As shown in Figure 85, at this time, the robot program "testModbusSlave.lua" has added an command that the robot Modbus slave station waits for digital input. After starting the program, the robot will wait for the value of the "A in place" coil register of the slave station to become true, that is, the value 1. Since the set timeout is 5s, when the "A in place" signal is still 0 after the robot waits for 5s, the robot program will report a timeout error and the program will automatically stop running.

As shown in Figure 87, at this time, the robot program "testModbusSlave.lua" has added an command that the robot Modbus slave station waits for the analog input value. After starting the program, the robot will wait for the slave station's "voltage" register value to be greater than 255. Since the set timeout time is 5s, when the robot waits for 5s and the "voltage" signal is still less than 255, the robot program will report a timeout error and the program will automatically stop running.

Open the ModbusTCP Slave command addition page, find the "Wait for Analog Input Setting" (i.e., wait for AI input register setting). Select the AI name as the configured "Liquid Level" register, set the wait condition to "=", the register value to 255, and the timeout to 5000ms. Click the "Add" button, and finally click the "Apply" button.

At this point, a Modbus Slave command to wait for the AI input register value has been added to the robot program "test.lua". After starting the program, the robot will continuously wait for the "Liquid Level" register value to equal 255. Since the timeout is set to 5s, if the "Liquid Level" signal still does not equal 255 after the robot waits for 5 seconds, the robot program will report a timeout error and automatically stop running.

ModbusTCP slave robot state feedback and control
******************************************************

The ModbusTCP slave input register addresses 310~473 of the cooperative robot are used to feed back the real-time status of the robot (see Annex 1: ModbusTCP slave address mapping table). You only need to read the value of the corresponding register with the master station equipment to obtain the corresponding real-time status data of the robot.

The coil register addresses 300~599 of ModbusTCP slave station of the cooperative robot are used for the master station equipment to control the robot (see Annex 1: ModbusTCP slave address mapping table). Taking coil address 502 as an example, this address function indicates "startup program".

When the robot is in automatic mode, the master station equipment sets the value of address 502 from 0 to 1, the robot automatically starts to run the currently configured program; Take the coil address 300 as an example. It is used to control the output of the robot control box DO0. When the external master station sets the coil address 300 from 0 to 1, the automatic output of the control box DO0 is valid. Similarly, when the external master station sets the coil address 300 from 1 to 0, the output of the control box DO0 is invalid. As shown in Figure 88, click "Function Digital Input (Coil)" on the ModbusTCP slave station setting page to monitor all current function digital inputs.

Robot Backgrounder Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Backgrounder Function
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The robot background program is a control program used to process the logical relationship of signals in the process of running the robot in the foreground motion program, and the background is also running, and the two are independent of each other in the operation relationship.

The background program can monitor the operating status of the foreground and at the same time send control signals to the foreground. The background program can also be connected with external devices through I/O communication to monitor and control the operation of robot peripheral equipment. Unlike the foreground teach-in, the background logic program can run commands, which cannot control any axis of motion. Therefore, it cannot be programmed with any robot axis motion commands. Only the logic control function and I/O communication function are retained.

When using a background program, the program scans in a loop from start to finish. The running cycle is 1 millisecond, and a delay function can be added to the background program to control the running cycle. During the execution of the background program, it is not affected by emergency stop, pause, or alarm. 

.. note:: Run up to 8 background programs at the same time.

A maximum of 8 programs can be executed at the same time as background logic, and an error alarm will be sent when the number of programs exceeds the maximum value.

When the power is cut off, the background logic program will be automatically loaded and run according to the set state the next time the power is turned on.

XY horizontal constant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
+++++++++++++++

The principle of lateral constant force grinding in the XY direction is as follows: Lateral constant force grinding refers to applying a grinding tool (such as a grinding wheel, grinding disc, etc.) with a constant force on a specified workpiece surface, and controlling the movement of the tool along the XY direction to maintain a constant grinding force at the contact point. 

Operation process of lateral constant force grinding function in XY direction
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To perform constant force grinding using a force sensor, it is necessary to install a grinding tool under the force sensor and configure the tool coordinate system. Click on the "Initial" -> "Base" -> "Coordinate" -> "TCP" button in sequence to enter the "Tool coordinate system settings" interface. Select the coordinate system to be set in the "Coordinate system name" (taking toolcoord 0 coordinate system as an example), and set it according to the size of the end tool.

Automatic Singularity Avoidance Trajectory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
+++++++++++++++

When the robot encounters a singular range that cannot be passed by the robot in the LIN and ARC command tracks, the robot will report an error or prompt the next digit to be strange or a singular warning appears. 

If you want to be able to reach the next waypoint that will pass through the singular range, you can use this function to avoid the singularity point through joint space or Cartesian space to reach the next target pose.

   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.21-1 A simple schematic diagram of a robot's singularity

The above figure is a schematic diagram of the robot singularity, the robot singularity includes three kinds of singularity: shoulder, elbow and wrist, and A is the 5 joint center WCP (Wrist Center Point), which is used to judge the shoulder singularity; B is the singular range of the shoulder, which resembles a cylinder, and its radius is the length of the robot DH parameter d4, and the robot enters the singular state when the WCP enters the cylinder B; C is the elbow singularity boundary of the robot, and the robot is in the elbow singularity state when J3=0 or 180°; D is the internal space, and it is in the wrist singular state when J5=0 or 180° at any position in the internal space.

.. note:: It should be noted that singularity is a motion characteristic determined by the physical structure of the robot, which should be avoided as much as possible during actual operation, and it will lead to changes in the terminal posture and speed and even configuration configuration when it is avoided by algorithms, and it is necessary to consider whether the side effects of avoidance affect the requirements before making a choice.

The trajectory automatically avoids the operation process of the singularity function

.. centered:: Figure 9.21-3 Turn on singularity avoidance switch

3.Singularity Avoidance parameters include Guard Mode, Shoulder Singularity, Elbow Singularity, and Wrist Singularity. Among them, the "protection mode" is divided into "joint mode" and "Cartesian mode", which means that the robot can cross the singular from the joint space or bypass the singular from the Cartesian space; The parameters of the "Singular Adjustment" specify the maximum deviation between the range of the determination of singularity and the singularity avoidance, which is mm for shoulder and elbow singularity units, and ° for wrist singular units.

.. note:: The joint space will select the nearest trajectory between the joints, so there will be no limit situation, and the joint limit may occur when the Cartesian space is avoided, so you need to pay attention to and adjust it during teaching.

After selecting and setting the singularity avoidance parameters, you can click the "Add" button to add the command, and then click "Apply" to add the LUA command to the program.

Singularity crossing function in automatic mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++

When the robot executes LIN or ARC commands and passes through a singularity, its speed may fluctuate drastically, leading to unstable motion control and even potential damage to the equipment. By utilizing the singularity crossing function, the robot can smoothly pass through singularities. This manual takes the example of the LIN command passing through a wrist singularity to illustrate how to use the singularity crossing function in automatic mode.

Real-time forward trajectory planning function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++

Real-time forward-looking trajectory planning is based on current and future path information, dynamically adjusting the robot's motion parameters such as speed and acceleration to ensure smoothness, continuity and accuracy of motion. By predicting the robot's future position and posture, forward-looking control can respond before the key points of the path, thereby avoiding unstable motion or trajectory errors due to sudden changes in speed and acceleration.

Operation process
++++++++++++++++++++++

**Step1**: Prepare a trajectory point file in "txt" format, in which each trajectory point is represented by a Cartesian pose.

**Step2**: Click the "Teaching Program"->"Programming" button in sequence, select the "Trajectory Forward" command in "Motion Command", and import and delete the trajectory file in "Command Configuration".

.. image:: coding/288.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.23-1 Import and delete trajectory files

**Step3**: Select the trajectory file to run and add the "Trajectory Preload" command: 

First, choose the fitting method for trajectory points in "Curve Fitting Method", including "Linear Connection", "Linear Fitting", "B-spline Curve", "Polynomial Optimization Method", etc. When selecting "Linear Fitting", additional error limits need to be set, which is not required for other methods. 

Then set the smoothing method and smoothing precision. Finally, configure the maximum velocity, maximum acceleration and maximum jerk during operation. The "Uniform Motion" option can be enabled for constant velocity lookahead, which will make the robot perform lookahead at constant speed when activated.

**Step4**: Add the "Trajectory Motion" command and generate Lua program. The imported trajectory file can be processed with real-time lookahead trajectory planning by running the Lua program. A typical real-time lookahead trajectory planning program is shown below.

Swing amplitude monotonous gradual arc tracking function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Swinging motion can realize two swinging amplitude switching modes: "sudden change" and "gradual change".

The "sudden change" mode refers to the mode of directly switching the swinging parameters of the previous section with the swinging parameters of the next section. It can be realized by setting two adjacent swinging motions with different parameters, or by issuing a new swinging number in real time during the swinging motion (see the manual section corresponding to the function for details, which will not be repeated here).

The "gradual change" mode means that in the current swinging motion, the swinging amplitude set at the beginning gradually changes to the swinging amplitude set at the end.

The swinging parameter gradual switching mode only supports the process of linear swinging.

Introduction
++++++++++++++

The swinging motion trajectory of monotonic gradual swinging amplitude is shown in the figure below.

.. image:: coding/293.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

Among them, the blue line is the swing direction, a is the swing amplitude of the starting point, and b is the swing amplitude of the ending point. The swing amplitude gradually changes during the movement.

.. note:: Please note that currently only the starting point and the end point are of the same type, the swing amplitude is different (from a to b), and the other parameters are consistent. It is recommended to check the swing parameters before executing the swing.

The operation process of setting a swing amplitude gradual swing is as follows:

**Step 1**: Click "Teaching Program", "Programming", select and click the "Swing" button under "Motion Instructions" to enter the swing instruction configuration page.

.. image:: coding/294.png
   :width: 3in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.24-1 Click the swing function button

**Step 2**: Select the swing parameter number at the start of the swing in the command editor, click "Start Swing" and then click the "Add" button.

   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.24-2 Add starting swing parameters

**Step 3**: Select the target number of the swing gradient, click "Swing gradient start", and click the "Add" button.

   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.24-3 Add gradual swing parameters

**Step 4**: After adding the corresponding linear motion, click "Swing Gradient End" and click Add, then click "Stop Swing" and add, complete the setting of a gradual swing motion, and click "Apply" to add it to the LUA program.

Offset arc tracking function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the arc tracking welding process, the robot defaults to adjusting the welding gun swing center to track the workpiece groove center according to the current information to keep consistent, but some process requirements require that the welding gun swing center has a certain offset relative to the workpiece groove center.
   
.. image:: coding/298.png
   :width: 3in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.25-1 Typical scenarios of bias arc tracking

Typical scenarios of the bias arc tracking function include: a. welding workpiece (welding groove is right angle or acute angle), b. welding gun, e. groove center line. The arc tracking function realizes the following for the welding groove: c. up and down (depth) direction tracking and d. left and right (center) direction tracking, f. left and right direction tracking offset distance.

To realize bias arc tracking, two methods of setting left and right offsets can be selected, namely "sampling" and "percentage" adjustment methods.

Sampling bias arc tracking
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The sampling method is to collect the left and right current values ​​during the swinging within a certain cycle as a reference after the swing welding arc is started, and compare the sampling current with the reference current in the subsequent welding process to obtain the tracking direction.

The sampling method requires teaching the swing welding starting position to the required offset, the offset shall not be greater than the swing amplitude, and the weld needs to cover the splicing groove.

The sampling bias instruction setting process is as follows:
   
.. image:: coding/299.png
   :width: 3in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.25-2 Click the arc tracking command button

**Step 1**: Click "Teaching Program", "Programming", select and click the "Arc Tracking" button under "Welding Command" to enter the arc tracking command configuration page.
   
.. image:: coding/300.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.25-3 Sampling bias arc tracking configuration page

**Step 2**: Bias arc tracking acts on left and right compensation. Click the "Left and Right Compensation" subpage, pull down and select "Sampling" in the bias mode, set the sampling start period (the sampling start period must be less than the left and right compensation start time), select "Start" for the instruction type, and click the Add button to generate the LUA instruction.
   
.. image:: coding/301.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.25-4 Add sampling bias arc tracking end instruction

**Step 3**: After adding the swing motion instruction, click to select the arc tracking instruction type "End", and click Add to generate the corresponding LUA instruction.

Percentage bias arc tracking
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The percentage bias is to gain the input sampling current by percentage during the arc tracking process, so that the current of the left and right swing cycles will deviate, and the robot will automatically compensate for the deviation signal.

.. note:: It should be noted that the smaller the swing amplitude and the larger the groove angle, the smaller the deviation of the left and right currents, and the smaller the adjustment percentage. It is recommended to debug with every 1% as the adjustment interval.

The percentage bias instruction setting process is as follows:
   
.. image:: coding/299.png
   :width: 3in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.25-5 Click the arc tracking command button

**Step 1**: Click "Teaching Program", "Programming", select and click the "Arc Tracking" button under "Welding Command" to enter the arc tracking command configuration page.
   
.. image:: coding/302.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.25-6 Sampling bias arc tracking configuration page

**Step 2**: Bias arc tracking acts on left and right compensation. Click the "Left and Right Compensation" subpage, pull down and select "Percent" in the bias mode, set the percentage value (positive value compensates the current gain of the first half cycle and the direction of the second half cycle, negative value is the opposite), select "Start" for the instruction type, and click the Add button to generate the LUA instruction.
   
.. image:: coding/303.png

.. centered:: Figure 9.25-7 Add percentage bias arc tracking end instruction

**Step 3**: After adding the swing motion instruction, click to select the arc tracking instruction type "End", and click Add to generate the corresponding LUA instruction.

T-Shape Velocity Characteristic Optimization + Blending Smoothing Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++++

Blending between two trajectory segments avoids frequent start-stop issues caused by complete stops, thereby improving robot motion efficiency. This function primarily performs blending between PTP, LIN, ARC, and CIRCLE instructions, achievable in two ways: using Lua instruction mode or motion configuration switch mode.

Robot ModbusRTU Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++++

ModbusRTU is a commonly used communication protocol in industrial production. FAIR collaborative robots provide two communication methods: ModbusRTU Master and ModbusRTU Slave. The collaborative robot supports up to 8 ModbusRTU Masters communicating simultaneously with external devices, with each master supporting up to 128 registers. The robot's ModbusRTU Slave has 64 coils, 64 discrete inputs, 32 holding registers, and 32 input registers (holding registers and input registers support both signed and floating-point data types).

Additionally, some input register addresses of the robot's ModbusRTU Slave are dedicated to feedback information such as current joint positions and motion speeds. Some coil register addresses are dedicated to controlling robot operations like starting programs, stopping programs, and setting control box DOs. The robot's ModbusRTU Slave only supports connection with one master. Detailed usage methods are described below.

Robot ModbusRTU Master Operation Instructions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before using the collaborative robot as a ModbusRTU Master to communicate with your device, please check the 485 hardware connection between your device and the robot. The steps to use the robot as a ModbusRTU Master are as follows: ① Add a master; ② Add registers; ③ Communication test; ④ Write user program; ⑤ Execute user program.

After correctly entering the above parameters, the robot ModbusRTU Master can communicate with the slave device. (If you have confirmed that the ModbusRTU Master parameters are correctly configured but communication fails, please check the following:

① Physical 485 connection between the robot and slave device; ② Check the slave device's communication configuration and test the communication link with a serial port debugging tool first. For example, configure the same ModbusRTU parameters on the PC, create a new register in the robot web interface, and perform a 0x03 read holding register operation to see if the serial port debugging tool receives data. As shown below, reading register address 0x1000 with 0x03 instruction, the PC can receive data normally, indicating correct communication configuration.)

Robot ModbusRTU Slave Operation Instructions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The robot ModbusRTU Slave provides four types of registers: general-purpose digital inputs (coils), general-purpose digital outputs (discrete inputs), general-purpose analog inputs (holding registers), and general-purpose analog outputs (input registers). The general-purpose digital inputs and analog inputs are mainly used for the robot to read data from external ModbusRTU Master devices to control robot operations. The general-purpose digital outputs and analog outputs are mainly used for the robot to send data signals to external ModbusRTU Master devices, which read the relevant register values to control their device operations.

In addition to the above general-purpose inputs and outputs, the robot also provides some "functional digital inputs (coils)" for external master devices to control robot operations such as starting programs and stopping programs. Some input registers are dedicated to displaying the current robot status information, including the robot's current Cartesian position and operation status (see Appendix 1: ModbusRTU Slave Address Mapping Table for specific definitions). The robot ModbusRTU Slave only supports connection with one master. The process of using the robot ModbusRTU Slave mainly includes: ① Parameter configuration; ② Communication test; ③ Program writing.

The robot ModbusRTU Slave provides 64 coil registers with addresses 0x4000~0x403F (see Appendix 1: ModbusRTU Slave Address Mapping Table for specific definitions). The general-purpose registers of the robot ModbusRTU Slave can be aliased. Change the name of the robot slave coil register DI0 to "A Ready" and DI1 to "B Ready". According to the address mapping table, the Modbus coil addresses for "A Ready" and "B Ready" are 0x4000 and 0x4001, respectively. On the external ModbusRTU Master device, set the robot slave coil register addresses 0x4000 and 0x4001 to 1. The indicator lights for these two registers on the robot ModbusRTU Slave monitoring page will light up.

The robot ModbusRTU Slave provides 64 discrete input registers with addresses 0x3000-0x303F (see Appendix 1: ModbusRTU Slave Address Mapping Table for specific definitions). Similarly, the discrete input registers of the robot ModbusRTU Slave can also be aliased. Click "General-Purpose Digital Outputs (Discrete Inputs)" to change the name of the robot slave discrete input register DO0 to "A Start" and DO1 to "B Start". According to the address mapping table, the Modbus discrete input addresses for "A Start" and "B Start" are 0x3000 and 0x3001, respectively. Click the indicator light corresponding to "A Start". The light will turn on, and the value of the corresponding register address 0x3000 will change to 1. The external ModbusRTU Master device can read this register value.

The robot provides three types of holding registers: unsigned, signed, and floating-point, totaling 32. The addresses for AI0~AI32 are 0x2000-0x202F (see Appendix 1: ModbusRTU Slave Address Mapping Table for specific definitions). The data range for signed registers is -32768~32767, and floating-point registers are displayed in big-endian format. Change the names of AI0 and AI1 to "Voltage" and "Current", respectively. From the ModbusRTU Slave address mapping table, the addresses of these two registers are 0x2000 and 0x2001, respectively. Therefore, when the connected master device modifies the values of holding register addresses 0x2000 and 0x2001, the "Voltage" and "Current" register address values on the robot ModbusRTU Slave monitoring page will update accordingly. The robot's analog inputs are mainly used for the robot to obtain numerical signals from external master devices.

The data range for signed registers is -32768~32767, and floating-point registers are displayed in big-endian format. Change the names of AO0 and AO1 to "Target Position A" and "Target Position B", respectively, with input register values of 2000 and 1500. From the ModbusRTU Slave address mapping table, the addresses of these two registers are 0x1000 and 0x1001, respectively. Therefore, when the connected master device reads the input register addresses 0x1000 and 0x1001, it will obtain the set values. The robot slave analog outputs are mainly used for the robot to send numerical signals to external master devices.

The read/write operations for analog outputs (input registers) and analog inputs (holding registers) are basically the same as those for digital outputs (discrete inputs) and digital inputs (coils). The difference is that the data range of the latter is limited to 0 or 1, while the former has a larger data range. Therefore, specific operations can refer to the writing of digital output and digital input programs.

Now the robot program "testModbusRTUSlave.lua" has added a robot Modbus Slave instruction to wait for a digital input. After starting the program, the robot will wait for the "A Ready" coil register value of the slave to become true (value 1). Since the timeout is set to 5s, if the "A Ready" signal is still 0 after 5s, the robot program will report a timeout error and automatically stop running.

Now the robot program "testModbusRTUSlave.lua" has added a robot Modbus Slave instruction to wait for an analog input value. After starting the program, the robot will wait for the "Current" register value of the slave to be greater than 255. Since the timeout is set to 5s, if the "Current" signal is still not greater than 255 after 5s, the robot program will report a timeout error and automatically stop running.

Open the ModbusRTU Slave command addition page, find the "Wait for Analog Input Setting" (i.e., wait for AI input register setting). Select the AI name as the configured "Liquid Level" register, set the wait condition to "=", the register value to 255, and the timeout to 5000ms. Click the "Add" button, and finally click the "Apply" button.

At this point, a Modbus RTU Slave command to wait for the AI input register value has been added to the robot program "test.lua". After starting the program, the robot will continuously wait for the "Liquid Level" register value to equal 255. Since the timeout is set to 5s, if the "Liquid Level" signal still does not equal 255 after the robot waits for 5 seconds, the robot program will report a timeout error and automatically stop running.

Robot Status Feedback and Control via ModbusRTU Slave
***********************************************************************************
The input register addresses 0x1010-0x104C of the collaborative robot ModbusRTU Slave are used to feedback real-time robot status (see Appendix 1: ModbusRTU Slave Address Mapping Table for specific address definitions). You only need to read the corresponding register values with the master device to obtain the corresponding real-time robot status data.

The coil register addresses 0x4040-0x405C of the collaborative robot ModbusRTU Slave are used for the master device to control the robot (see Appendix 1: ModbusRTU Slave Address Mapping Table for specific address definitions). Take coil address 0x4054 as an example. This address function is "Start Program". When the robot is in automatic mode, the master device changes the value of address 0x4054 from 0 to 1, and the robot automatically starts running the currently configured program. Another example is coil address 0x4040, which is used to control the output of control box DO0. When the external master changes the coil address 0x4040 from 0 to 1, the control box DO0 automatically outputs effectively. Similarly, when the external master changes the coil address 0x4040 from 1 to 0, the control box DO0 output becomes invalid. On the ModbusRTU Slave settings page, click "Functional Digital Inputs (Coils)" to monitor all current functional digital inputs.

Protection Based on 6-Axis Force Sensor Posture Compliance Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++++

Current FR robots have no maximum adjustment angle limit in posture compliance function under constant force FT_Control. When the 6-axis force sensor receives external torque, the robot end will continuously deviate, which may cause hazards.

This enhancement adds maximum adjustment angle limit on top of the FT_Control posture compliance function, allowing custom threshold setting to make posture compliance smoother.

Operation Procedure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Step1**: Click "Initial Setup"->"Basic"->"Coordinate System"->"Tool" to enter the tool coordinate system setup interface. Select "Coordinate System Name" and configure parameters for the end tool coordinate system.
   
.. image:: coding/443.png
   :width: 4in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.31-1 Tool Coordinate System Setup

**Step2**: Click "Teach Programming"->"Program Editing" to write constant force control Lua script. Select "Force Control Set"->"Control", add force control motion command, set "Posture Compliance" to ON, and configure maximum adjustment angle as the threshold.
   
.. image:: coding/444.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.31-2 Force Control Motion Command

**Step3**: On web interface click "FT" to set 6-axis force sensor reference coordinate system. Select reference coordinate system as "Custom Coordinate System" and configure corresponding parameters.
When posture compliance adjusts around tool coordinate system, set reference coordinate parameters to "0"; when adjusting around end flange coordinate system, set parameters to match the end tool coordinate system.

   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.31-3 Setting 6-Axis Force Sensor Reference Coordinate System

**Step4**: Run the script to observe posture compliance effect. The adjustment angle under constant force will be limited within the custom maximum adjustment angle range.

Socket Communication Interface Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Socket Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When using the Socket communication interface function, after the robot is powered on, you need to first access the web page to configure the Socket protocol. The configuration is saved after power-off.

Click "Teach Program" - "Program Editing", then click "Socket Network Debugging" in the upper right menu bar to enter the Socket configuration interface. Click "Add Socket" to configure Socket parameters. Up to four Sockets can be added.

   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.32-2 Socket Configuration Parameters Interface

Communication Parameter Settings
********************************************

The communication protocol supports UDP, TCP server, and TCP client.

Data types support both ASCII and HEX. After configuring the data type, all data transmission and reception for that Socket connection will be processed according to the configured type.

Heartbeat Detection Mechanism
********************************************
The heartbeat detection mechanism is only applicable to TCP server and TCP client.

The heartbeat detection mechanism uses the Keepalive mechanism to detect and maintain the active state of the connection, preventing accidental interruption of long-idle connections. It mainly includes the following parameters:

- Probe interval: How long to wait before sending keepalive probe packets (in seconds);
- Probe time: Interval between probe packets (in seconds);
- Probe count: Maximum number of probe packets to send.

Reconnection Mechanism
********************************************
The reconnection mechanism is only applicable to TCP client.

When the reconnection mechanism is enabled and the TCP client detects a server disconnection upon startup, it will actively attempt to reconnect. If the connection cannot be established after reaching the maximum reconnection attempts, the connection will be dropped. It mainly includes the following parameters:

- Reconnection interval: Reconnection interval time (in ms, recommended to be in seconds);
- Maximum reconnection attempts: Maximum number of reconnection attempts.
  
Custom Protocol Parsing
********************************************
When custom protocol parsing is enabled, the transmitted and received data will be encapsulated or parsed according to the protocol configuration.

Custom protocols can be automatically generated based on configuration parameters. In ASCII mode, frame header, frame count, data length, and frame tail combinations are supported. Delimiters can be used for data segmentation. In HEX mode, frame header, frame count, data length, checksum method, and frame tail combinations are supported.

Robot Linear, Circular, and Full Circle Motion Setting Physical Speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LUA Programming
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Linear Command
********************************
Click the "Linear" icon to enter the Lin command editing interface.

The function of this command is similar to the "PTP" command, but the path to the point reached by this command is a straight line.

.. image:: coding/457.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.33-1 Lin Command Addition Interface

The LIN command allows selecting the motion speed mode as "Percentage" or "Physical Speed":

- Percentage: Input the debugging speed percentage. The robot moves at a percentage of its maximum speed. The actual robot motion speed is calculated as: V = Robot Maximum Speed × Global Speed Percentage × Debugging Speed Percentage. Hover the mouse over the small eye icon to the right of the "Debugging Speed" input box to display the actual physical speed (unit: mm/s) of the robot in both manual and automatic modes under the current debugging speed setting.

.. image:: coding/458.png
   :width: 5in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.33-2 Input Percentage to Display Actual Physical Speed Value

- Physical Speed: The input speed is the actual operating speed of the robot, unit mm/s; the input acceleration is usually set to twice the speed. (The maximum physical speed of the LIN command is limited by the global speed percentage. If the robot's maximum operating speed is 1000mm/s and the global speed is 50%, then the maximum physical speed for the LIN command is 1000 × 50% = 500mm/s).

.. centered:: Figure 9.33-3 Input Actual Physical Speed

Circular Arc Command
*********************************

Click the "Circular Arc" icon to enter the Arc command editing interface.

The "Arc" command is for circular motion and includes three points: the first point is the arc start point, the second point is the arc intermediate transition point, and the third point is the end point.

Both the transition point and the end point can be set for offset, you can choose offset based on the base coordinate system or based on the tool coordinate system, and pop-up settings for x, y, z, rx, ry, rz offsets appear. The end point can set a smooth transition radius to achieve a continuous motion effect. (Arc motion requires first adding a PTP or Lin command to move to the start point).

.. image:: coding/460.png

Impedance Control Function During Robot Motion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The impedance control function enables real-time detection of external forces. When the set threshold is reached, it actively complies with the external force, deviates from the motion trajectory, and returns to the motion trajectory after the external force drops below the threshold, thereby achieving better human-robot interaction. When an external force exceeding the preset force threshold is detected, this function drives the robotic arm to generate an offset in the direction of the force, achieving an active avoidance effect. After the external force is removed, the robotic arm returns to the vicinity of the original motion trajectory, thus enhancing safety during human-robot collaboration.

Impedance Control Configuration and Function Start/Stop in Cartesian Space
******************************************************************************************

**Step1**: Log in to the web interface, sequentially click "Initial Settings" → "Basic" → "Joints" → "Collision Level" to enter the robot collision level setting module, and set a reasonable collision coefficient, as shown in Figure 2-1.

.. image:: coding/473.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.34-1 Robot Collision Coefficient Setting Module

**Step2**: To use a force sensor to implement the impedance control function, the force sensor must be configured in the end effector peripheral configuration under "Peripherals" → "End Effector". If choosing not to use a force sensor to implement the impedance control function, this step is not required.

**Step3**: Sequentially click "Teach Program" → "Program Programming" → "Force Control Set", and add the "Impedance" command. The "Impedance" command enables the robot to implement impedance control on the running trajectory (Currently, only impedance control in Cartesian space is available).

.. image:: coding/474.png

   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.34-2 Adding Force Control Command

**Step4**: In the force control command module, select "Cartesian Space" from the space selection dropdown menu. Set appropriate values in the text boxes for force threshold, mass coefficient, damping coefficient, stiffness coefficient, maximum linear velocity, maximum linear acceleration, maximum angular velocity, and maximum angular acceleration. Click "Enable" under command type, then click "Add" to add the impedance control enable command; click "Disable" under command type, then click "Add" to add the impedance control disable command.

.. centered:: Figure 9.34-3 Impedance Control Command Example

**Step5**: During operation, if the robotic arm stops running and the lower left corner of the Web interface displays "500 Error: Current collision level is too low", this is because the set force threshold is greater than the trigger threshold of the collision level. At this point, increasing the collision level or decreasing the force threshold will resolve this error.

   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 9.34-4 Collision Level Too Low Warning

**Step6**: During operation, if the robotic arm stops running and the lower right corner of the Web interface displays "Collision Fault", this is because the external force on the robotic arm has exceeded the trigger threshold of the collision level, thereby triggering a collision fault.

Specific Functions and Recommended Values of Parameters:

- Space Selection: Sets the operational space for impedance control. Currently, only Cartesian space impedance control is available.
- Force Threshold: The minimum trigger force for impedance control. The range for the translational direction force threshold is 30–150N, and for the rotational direction force threshold is 7–30Nm.
- Mass Coefficient: Increasing the mass coefficient will cause the offset to be slower, decreasing it will cause the robot offset to be too fast. The range for the translational direction is [0.01-1], recommended value is 0.04; the range for the rotational direction is [0.001-1], recommended value is 0.01.
- Damping Coefficient: Increasing the damping coefficient will cause the offset to be slower, decreasing it will cause the robot offset to be too fast, resulting in oscillation. The range for the translational direction is [0.1-2], recommended value is 0.1; the range for the rotational direction is [0.008-1.5], recommended value is 0.08.
- Stiffness Coefficient: Increasing the stiffness coefficient will cause the offset to be slower. Recommended value is 0.
- Maximum Linear Velocity: Limits the velocity generated by external forces in the translational direction. Recommended value is 250mm/s.
- Maximum Linear Acceleration: Limits the acceleration generated by external forces in the translational direction. Recommended value is 500mm/s².
- Maximum Angular Velocity: Limits the angular velocity generated by external forces in the rotational direction. Recommended value is 90°/s.
- Maximum Angular Acceleration: Limits the angular acceleration generated by external forces in the rotational direction. Recommended value is 180°/s².

Custom Weaving Welding Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The custom weaving welding function allows the execution of weaving using a pattern designed by the user.

Description of the Custom Weaving Welding Function:

- (1) In the weaving parameters interface, select any one of the weaving types: "Custom Weave 0", "Custom Weave 1", or "Custom Weave 2". A maximum of 3 custom weaving patterns can be set.
- (2) The number of custom weaving endpoints can be set to a maximum of 10 and a minimum of 2. The X, Y, Z data of the last endpoint is fixed at 0 and cannot be modified, though the dwell time for all endpoints can be set.
- (3) The X, Y, and Z values of the custom weaving endpoints must be within the range of -10mm to 10mm, and the weaving frequency must not exceed 10 Hz.
- (4) Currently, linear, circular, and full-circle trajectories support custom weaving welding, but the weaving gradient function is not yet supported.
- (5) Note: When the weaving dwell time is set to "Include", the total weaving dwell time must not exceed half of the weaving cycle time.

Operational Procedure for Custom Weaving Welding Function
