Install the robot arm and control box
------------------------------------------

Install the robot arm and control box according to the 3.5 and 3.6 in the hardware installation of Chapter 3.

-  Take out the robotic arm and use 4 M8 bolts with a strength of not less than 8.8 levels to install the robot arm. Install the robot arm on a strong and shock -proof surface. If it is fixed with aluminum plate, the thickness of the aluminum plate is not less than 16mm. If the iron plate is fixed, the thickness of the iron plate is not less than 8mm;

-  Place the control box on its feet;

-  Connect the robot arm ontology to the heavy load interface of the control box;

-  Plug the button box aviation plug into the control box exemporary instrument interface. 

-  Make sure the power button of the control box is turned off (the button is turned to 0) and connect the power cord to the power socket;

-  Plug in the power control box plug.

.. warning:: 
   (1) If the robot is placed on a strong surface, the robot may dump and cause damage.

   (2) Do not quickly switch the power of the control box on and off. It is recommended that the time between switching the power of the control box off and on again be greater than 1 minute.

Demonstrate startup control robot
-------------------------------------

The control box is connected to the robot arm, the teaching box, and the physical electrical input/output terminal of any peripheral equipment. You must open the control box to power the robot's arm.

-  Press the power button of the control box to open the control box;

-  After starting the robot, at this time the robot is manual mode and has not enabled. If the robot needs to be operated in the manual mode, you need to press the three bits on the teaching pendant to switch off (let go) ⇒ OFF (press) as the switch as a switch Drag or control the robot movement when you are on your state.

-  If you do not need to operate the robot in the manual mode, you can use the key switch to switch the robot working mode on the key to switch the button: automatic, manual, custom;

-  When switching the robot's manual state, check whether there is abnormal abnormality inside and outside the safety space and to operate the machine's operation carefully;

-  When switching the robot's automatic state, check the safety measures and return to the normal state and operate the machine operation carefully;

-  When the teaching pendant cannot be opened normally, please check whether the device connection is normal.

Button box control robot movement
---------------------------------------

Refer to the 3.6.3 of the hardware installation of Chapter 3. The end LED definition of the end to control the robot. The existing button boxes are divided into 60-button box (POE)(BX01), 60-button box (POE)(BX02)-V1.0, 60-button box (POE)(BX02)-V2.0.

Taking the 60-button box (POE)(BX01) as an example, the operation steps are as follows.

Not paired with teaching pendant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Step1**:Turn on the power switch of the robot control box, start the robot, wait for the end LED to display green for a long time before operating the robot, as shown in figure below.

Teaching pendant control robot movement
--------------------------------------------------

Click the "Program" button in the first-level menu on the left side of the teaching pendant, and click the sub -menu "Coding" to enter the program demonstration interface. The interface mainly implements the writing and modification of the robot teaching program.

After clicking the "New" icon button, the user names the file and selects a template as the content of the new file. Click the newly created to create a successful and open the program file.

.. warning:: 
   Your head and trunk cannot be located in the range (work area) that the robot can reach. Please do not put your fingers in the place where the robot can grasp.

.. important:: 
   - Don't let the robot move to yourself or other objects, because it will cause damage to the robot.
   - This is just a quick start guide to teach you how to easily use FR collaborative robots. The premise of this guide is that the environment is safe and harmless, and users are cautious. Do not increase the speed or acceleration to the default value. Before the robot enters the operation, risk assessment is always carried out.
