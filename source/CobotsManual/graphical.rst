Introduction
--------------------

Since the teaching pendant is generally not connected to external peripherals such as keyboard and mouse, when accessing the robot WebAPP on the teaching pendant side, users can edit the robot teaching program through the graphical programming function. Functional standardization functions are implemented using the Blockly library, which can be integrated into the WebAPP system, and custom code blocks can be implemented as needed. After dragging and dropping programming, it is converted into a LUA program and sent and run through the existing instruction protocol.

By using graphical programming, it can be simple and easy to understand, easy to operate, and Chinese language operation.

The page is divided into three areas: "operation bar", "toolbox toolbar" and "workspace code editing area". The overall layout design is as follows.

**Operation bar**

1) **Load**: responsible for reloading the workspace;

2) **Import**: responsible for importing related graphical programming programs;

3) **Export**: responsible for exporting the saved graphical programming programs in the workspace. The "Save" button function is to save the code block as the corresponding teaching program after editing is completed;

4) **Save**: responsible for saving the edited graphical code block;

5) **Clear**: responsible for quickly clearing the code editing area;

6) **Code**: responsible for translating code blocks into Lua code.

**Toolbox**

1) Code blocks containing all instructions and logic codes can be dragged to the workspace to create code blocks and edit them;

2) The Toolbox toolbar section will be further classified according to the instruction type;

3) Logic instructions: if-else, while, etc;

4) Basic motion instructions: PTP, LIN, ARC, etc. Instructions are classified according to application scenarios: gluing, welding, conveyor belts, etc. You can easily find the required code blocks during use.

**Workspace**: Graphical code blocks can be edited and displayed in the code editing area.

Graphical programming command usage example
-----------------------------------------------------
After selecting the graphical programming type, click the graphical code block to be used, and you can drag and splice it in the workspace.

For example, select PTP and Lin motion instructions and control instruction Waitms for splicing. The outer layer can nest a folding advanced instruction and enter the comment name to achieve code block folding operation.

Click the drop-down box to select the instruction parameter type, and the input box can be filled in with instruction parameter data. The following are examples of graphical programming commands:

After completing the splicing of graphical programming instructions and filling in parameters, fill in the workspace name and click the "Save" icon to save this program. Select the "workspace" that has been written, click Start Run, and you can execute this program.

Modularization of graphical programming code blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to improve the readability of graphical programming codes, the modularization function of graphical programming code blocks has been added, namely, advanced instructions: folding instruction code blocks.

1. Write a code block instruction, add a folding instruction code block in the outer layer, and write the remarks of the instruction in the input box.

2. Right-click "Fold Block" in the right-click operation bar, and the instruction code block will be folded. The code block is folded into a line and the program can be executed correctly when folded.

Graphical programming same name overwrite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the graphical programming page, after creating/loading a file, change the workspace name and click Save. If the changed workspace name file already exists, the "Teaching point already exists" pop-up box will be triggered, as shown below.

**Step1**: Click the "Cancel" button to continue the previous operation.

**Step2**: Click the "Synchronize and update teaching program" checkbox, and then click the "Overwrite" button, the lua program on the current graphical programming page will overwrite the lua program of the changed workspace file name.

Graphical programming program not saved verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the graphical programming page, after opening/creating a new program, if the graphical programming program is changed but not saved.

If you click the "Open" file operation, the "Save this program" pop-up box will be triggered, prompting "The current program has changed, do you want to save the changes to this program?", as shown in the figure below.

**Step1**: Click the "Don't Save" button to continue the previous "Open" file operation.

**Step2**: Click the "Save" button, the unsaved Lua program is saved successfully, and the previous "Open" file operation is continued.

If you leave the graphical programming page and switch to other pages, the "Do you want to save this program" prompt will also be triggered, and you will still stay on the current graphical programming page, as shown below.

**Step1**: Click the "Don't Save" button to jump to the previously selected page.

**Step2**: Click the "Save" button, the unsaved Lua program is saved successfully, and jumps to the previously selected page. If the saved program name already exists, it prompts that the teaching point already exists, whether to overwrite. After canceling/overwriting, jump to the previously selected page.
