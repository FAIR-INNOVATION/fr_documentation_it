To avoid potential safety hazards during backup package import that may arise from inconsistencies in installation methods and other configurations, a validation function for key parameters during backup package import has been added.

Backup Package Import Validation Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A validation function is added during backup package import. The backup package must be compared with the target robot for key parameters, as listed in the table below. Inaccurate settings of these parameters can pose safety risks. The backup package can only be imported normally when all parameters match exactly. If inconsistent, an error will be prompted, and the key parameters in the target robot need to be checked for consistency with the backup package.

Drag Locking
----------------------------

Under the "Applications" -> "Tool App" menu bar, click "Drag Locking" to enter the drag teaching lock configuration function interface.

A degree-of-freedom locking function has been added for drag teaching. When the drag teaching function switch is set to enable, the degree-of-freedom parameters take effect when the user drags the robot. For example, when the parameters are set to X:10, Y:0, Z:10, RX:10, RY:10, RZ:10, dragging the robot in drag mode restricts movement to only the Y direction. If you need to keep the robot's posture unchanged during dragging and only move in the X, Y, Z directions, set X, Y, Z to 0 and RX, RY, RZ to 10.

Normal Collision Protection Triggering Under Force Sensor Assisted Dragging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
++++++++++++++++++++++

Currently, FR robots cannot trigger collision protection under force sensor assisted dragging. This enhancement adds the capability to trigger collision protection during force sensor assisted dragging, increasing robot safety and reducing operational risks.

Collision Protection
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Step1**: Click "Applications" -> "Tool App" -> "Drag Locking" to enter the Force Sensor Assisted Locking configuration interface. Set the "Status Switch" and "Collision Detection" to ON, as shown below.

.. centered:: Figure 14.5‑2 Configuring Force Sensor Assisted Locking

**Step2**: Drag the robot. During robot movement, apply external force to the joints to trigger collision protection. The web interface will report the error "Force Sensor Assisted Dragging Collision Fault", and you can quickly resume/disable force sensor assisted dragging via the web interface, as shown. Click "Resume" to clear the error and resume force sensor assisted dragging; click "Disable" to clear the error and keep force sensor assisted dragging disabled.

.. centered:: Figure 14.5‑3 Collision Triggered Under Force Sensor Assisted Dragging

.. note::
   Under force sensor assisted dragging, the robot itself is in a stopped state. During dragging, there is a difference between the joint torque command and feedback. It is recommended to set the collision level to level 7 or higher. Setting the collision level too low may cause false collision errors during dragging.

Parameters Calibration of Joint Torque Sensor on the Whole Machine
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
************************

Joint torque sensor sensitivity refers to the sensor's responsiveness to torque changes, describing the proportional relationship between the sensor's output voltage and the actual joint torque being measured. Linearity measures how well a regression model fits the observed data. Hysteresis error is the maximum difference between measurements during forward stroke (from small to large) and reverse stroke (from large to small) under the same test conditions for the joint torque sensor's raw data. Repeatability is the ratio of the current test result to the previous test result, used to determine the repeatability accuracy of the joint torque sensor.

The parameter calibration method involves running the robot through a predetermined trajectory, and calculating the joint torque sensor's sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis error, and repeatability accuracy by acquiring joint gravity torque and joint torque sensor raw data under different postures.

Parameter Calibration
********************************

**Step1**: Set the tool coordinate system to "Tool0". Click "Auxiliary Applications" -> "Tool Applications" -> "Drag Lock". In the joint torque sensor whole-machine drag module, click "Function Enable", as shown in Figure 2-1.

.. centered:: Figure 14.5‑4 Function Enable

**Step2**: After clicking "Function Enable", proceed with sensitivity calibration, as shown in Figure 2-2. Click "Generate Program" to deploy the internal controller Lua script. Switch the robot to automatic mode and set the run speed to "10". Click "Run" and wait for the robot to move.

.. note:: If the joint torque sensor sensitivity calibration is already completed, you can proceed directly to drag function parameter settings.

**Step3**: After the robot completes running the predetermined trajectory, the sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis error, and repeatability calibration results are automatically displayed on the web interface. Click "Set" to apply, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Intersection Point Generation (Laser Point Capture Motion)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During welding, the laser point capture motion can be configured with posture, enabling the robot to achieve the expected posture when reaching the position point. This easily handles special scenarios such as fillet welds and groove welds.

Laser Point Capture Motion Function Operation Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step1**: Before using the laser sensor, first apply the "Welding Torch" tool coordinate system to the current tool coordinate system. Open the Teach Page, click "Initial Setup", "Basic", "Tool Coordinates" in sequence, select "Welding Torch" as the coordinate system name and apply it. The tool coordinate system in the system status bar will display as Tool1.

.. figure:: application/010.png

.. centered:: Figure 14.6‑1 Apply Welding Torch Coordinate System

**Step2**: Write the laser point capture motion Lua program. Click "Teach Program" -> "Program Programming" -> "New Button" in sequence, and create a new user program "testPointRecord.lua".

.. figure:: application/011.png

.. centered:: Figure 14.6‑2 New Laser Point Capture Motion Program

**Step3**: Configure the reference posture teach point (Optional). In manual mode, drag the robot to the desired welding posture. On the Teach Page, click "Teach Point Record", "Name Point" in sequence, and save the posture teach point as "referencePoint".

.. figure:: application/012.png

.. centered:: Figure 14.6‑3 Save Posture Reference Teach Point

**Step4**: Generate the laser point capture motion program. Click "Teach Program" -> "Program Programming" -> "Welding Instructions", "Laser Tracking" in sequence, scroll down to the Sensor Point Capture Motion section, select the required "Motion Mode", "Debug Speed", and posture reference point to generate the corresponding laser point capture LUA program.

If no posture reference point is selected, the posture at the point of capture is maintained by default during motion. If a posture reference point is selected, the robot moves to the laser-captured point using the reference posture.

Execute the laser point capture motion. Drag the robot so that the laser sensor beam points to the desired weld seam point. The laser sensor will acquire the weld seam position and capture the point. After executing the laser point capture motion, the welding torch will move to the point scanned by the laser sensor using the reference posture.

Finding Intersection Coordinates Using Three-Point and Four-Point Seam Finding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When it is inconvenient to directly teach the position of a fillet weld, the collaborative robot can calculate the intersection point of the two plate planes by manually teaching or finding the positions on both sides of the fillet weld, thereby generating the location of the fillet weld.

For right-angle fillet welds, the three-point seam finding method can be used to calculate the intersection coordinates; for non-right-angle fillet welds, the four-point seam finding method is used.

Both command and Lua script methods are provided to obtain the intersection coordinates for seam finding motion, and a reference posture can be configured, allowing the robot carrying the welding torch to move to the intersection point with the posture of the reference teach point.

G-code to Robot Trajectory Planning Function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Function Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The G-code to Robot Trajectory Planning function uses CAD software to convert paths (lines, arcs, full circles, splines) into G-code files with the ".gcode" extension. The G-code for spline paths consists of many small line segments. Importing the generated G-code file on the Web端 converts it and generates a LUA file.

G-code to Robot Trajectory Planning function description:

(1) The Web can only import G-code files with the ".gcode" extension. Upon successful conversion, a LUA file with the same name as the G-code file is generated. If a LUA file with the same name already exists before conversion, the conversion will fail.

(2) Currently, it can convert rapid move G0, linear interpolation G1, clockwise arc interpolation G2, and counterclockwise arc interpolation G3 commands in G-code. G0 corresponds to the MoveJ instruction, G1 corresponds to MoveL, arcs (G2/G3) correspond to MoveC, and full circles (G2/G3) correspond to the Circle instruction.

(3) Currently, only G-code for arcs and circles in the XY plane can be converted.

(4) The spindle speed S set in G-code instructions corresponds to the speed in the MoveJ instruction. The unit of spindle speed is revolutions per minute (RPM), corresponding to millimeters per minute (mm/min) for move speed. The feedrate F corresponds to the speed in MoveL, MoveC, and Circle. The unit of feedrate is millimeters per minute (mm/min), consistent with the move speed unit. The speed settings in G-code must not exceed the robot's maximum moving speed.

(5) When executing the converted LUA file, the robot needs to have the speed percentage in the upper right corner of the Web interface changed to 100.

Operation Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calculation of the robot's posture along the working path is shown in the figure below.

.. image:: application/030.png
   :width: 6in
   :align: center

.. centered:: Figure 14.8-1 Robot Posture Calculation Schematic

Where P-xyz is the posture of the recorded reference posture teach point, and O-xy is the coordinate system of the CAD drawing. The robot's posture at the starting point A is the reference posture. Based on the angle between the Z-axis of the reference posture and the CAD drawing plane, and the angle between the projection of the Z-axis on the CAD drawing plane and the tangent at the path's starting point, the robot's posture at intermediate point B and endpoint C of the path is calculated.

The functional operation process is as follows:

**Step 1**: Use CAD software with CAM functionality to convert the machining path into a G-code file, and use a G-code simulator, such as NC Viewer, to verify the correctness of the tool path.

**Step 2**: Before converting G-code to robot trajectory, first calibrate the tool coordinate system and the workpiece coordinate system. Note that the workpiece coordinate system needs to coincide with the machine coordinate system in the CAD software.

.. centered:: Figure 14.8-2 Tool and Workpiece Coordinate System Calibration Interface

**Step 3**: Under the calibrated tool coordinate system and workpiece coordinate system, record a reference posture teach point. The robot's posture along the working path will be calculated using the posture of this reference point.

**Step 4**: Click "Applications", "Tool App", "G-code Conversion" button in sequence to enter the G-code file to robot motion LUA file interface.

.. image:: application/033.png

.. centered:: Figure 14.8-3 G-code Conversion Interface

**Step 5**: Click the "Select File" button to find the G-code file that needs conversion. Note that the file extension of the G-code file must be ".gcode". Select the reference posture point recorded in Step 2. Upon successful selection, the tool coordinate system and workpiece coordinate system of the currently selected teach point will be displayed below. Finally, click the "Convert" button. Upon successful conversion, a "G-code Conversion Successful" message will appear. Additionally, if a LUA file with the same name as the G-code file already exists, clicking the "Convert" button will prompt that the filename already exists.
