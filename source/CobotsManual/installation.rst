Instructions for security
----------------------------

Brief introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This manual will use the following warnings. The role of these warnings is to ensure the safety of personal and equipment. When you read this manual, you must comply with and execute all the assembly instructions and guidelines in other chapters in this manual. This is very important. Pay special attention to text related to warning signs.

.. important:: 
    - If the robot (robot body, control box, teaching pendant, or button box) is damaged, changed or modified due to anthropogenic causes, FAIR INNOVATION refuses to bear all responsibilities;
    - FAIR INNOVATION is not responsible for any damage caused by the robot or any other device due to errors written by customers or any other device.

Personnel safety
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running the robot system, we must first ensure the safety of the operators. The general precautions are listed below. Please take corresponding measures to ensure the safety of the operator.

1. All operators who use the robot system should be trained through training courses sponsored by the FAIR INNOVATION (Suzhou) ROBOTIC SYSTEM COMPANY. Users need to ensure that they fully grasp the safe and standardized operating processes and have the qualifications for robotic operations. For training details, please check with our company, the mailbox is jiling@frtech.fr.

2. All operators who use the robot system, please do not wear loose clothes or jewelry. Make sure the long hair beam is behind the head when operating the robot.

3. During the operation of the device, even if the robot seems to have stopped, it may be because the robot is waiting to start the signal and is in a state of motion. Even in such a state, the robot should be regarded as in action.

4. The lines should be drawn on the floor to mark the scope of the robot, so that the operator understands the action range of the robot includes holding tools (robotics, tools, etc.).

5. Ensure safety measures (such as guardrails, ropes, or protective screens) near the robotic operation area to protect operators and surrounding people. Locks should be set up as needed, so that those who are responsible for operations cannot reach the power supply of the robot.

6. When using the operating panel and teaching pendant, because you may have an operational error in wearing gloves, you must work after taking off the gloves.

7. Under the emergency and abnormalities of people being pinched or wrapped inside by a robot, pushing or pulling the robot arm by force (at least 700 N) to force joint movements. With a power-free driver, the arm of the manual mobile robot is limited to emergency and may damage the joint.

Danger recognition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Risk assessment should consider all potential contact between operators and robots during normal use and foreseeable misunderstandings. The operator's neck, face, and head should not be exposed to avoid touch. Using robots without using peripheral safety protection devices requires the first risk assessment to determine whether the relevant hazards will constitute an unacceptable risk, such as

-  There may be danger of using a sharp end actuator or tool connector;

-  There may be danger of treatment of toxicity or other harmful substances;

-  The operator's finger has the danger of being clamped by a robot base or joint;

-  The danger of collision by robots;

-  The danger of robots or tools connected to the end not being fixed in place;

-  The risk of the impact between the effective load and the strong surface of the robot.

Integrates must measure such dangers and related risk levels through risk assessment, and determine and implement corresponding measures to reduce the risk to acceptable levels. Please note that there may be other major dangers in specific robots.

By combining the inherent security design measures used by FR robots with the safety specifications or risk assessment implemented by integrated and end users, the risks related to FR collaborative operations will be reduced to a reasonable and feasible level. Through this document, any remaining risk of the robot can be conveyed to the integrated and end users before installation. If the risk assessment of the integrator determines that the existence of a specific application that may have unacceptable risks that may constitute unacceptable risks, integrators must
appropriate risk reduction measures must be taken to eliminate or minimize these dangers until the risk is reduced to acceptable levels. It is not safe to use before taking appropriate risk reduction measures (if necessary).

If the robot is installed in non-synergistic installation (for example, when using a hazardous tool), risk assessment may infer the integrated provider to connect additional safety equipment (such as safety startup equipment) to ensure personnel and equipment safety when programming.

Pre-use evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After using a robot or any modification for the first time, the robot's default speed is less than 250mm/s. Do not log in to the administrator to modify the speed to enter the high-speed mode. After that, the following test must be performed. It is confirmed that all security input and output are correct and the connection is correct. Test whether all connected security input and output (including multiple machines or robots shared equipments) are normal. So you must:

-  Test whether the emergency stop button and input can stop the robot and start the brake.

-  Test whether the protection input can stop the robot movement. If the protection reset is configured, check if you need activation before recovery.

-  The test operation mode can switch the operation mode, see the icon in the upper right corner of the user interface.

-  Test whether the 3rd gear actuation device must be pressed to activate in manual mode, and the robot is under deceleration control (the robot software version V3.0 does not support this function).

-  Test whether the system emergency stop output can bring the entire system to a safe state.

Emergency stop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The emergency stop button is type 0 stop. Press the emergency stop button to stop all the movements of the robot immediately.

The following table shows the stop distance and stop time of the type 0 stop. These measurement results correspond to the following configuration of the robot:

Software Settings Related to Digital Output of Control Box
***************************************************************

There are two software setting items for digital output: "Control Box DO Output During Power-On" and "DO0-D07 General Output Valid Status". "Control Box DO Output During Power-On" represents the output level during the power-on period of the control box when the control system has not completed initialization. It can correspond to different output valid states, which can flexibly meet the requirements for output status during power-on. "General Output Valid Status" represents the digital output voltage level value that needs to be controlled when the output is valid. This setting allows users to use digital output more flexibly.

Load curves for all FR series models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
+++++++++++++++

The load curves in this section are based on the tests of each model under specific trajectories. The load curves of each model have two parts: "full performance" and "extended load capacity", as follows:

(1) The operating environment of "full performance" is: the friction compensation coefficient of each joint is 1; the collision level of each joint is 10; the web interface is set to 100% operating speed and 360deg/s2 acceleration; dynamics 2.0. In this environment, the "full performance" part of the load curve is suitable for most operating trajectories.

(2) If the end load is in the "extended load capacity", the "time optimal mode" must be turned on and the acceleration limit must be met, or the robot's working range must be reduced.

Parameter Description
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The rated payload of the robot depends on the center of gravity offset of the payload, where the center of gravity offset is defined as the distance between the center of the end flange and the center of gravity of the attached payload.

(2) When the load is 20kg to 25kg, it is the extended load capacity, see the "red envelope", at this time the robot can operate in the following states:

  ① Turn on the "time optimal mode", it is recommended to set the acceleration to less than 150deg/s\ :sup:`2`;

  ② Reduce the robot's working range or reduce the operating speed.

Safety I/O
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the electrical specifications of security I/O, and must abide by the general electrical specifications in Section 3.5.6.

Safety devices and equipment must be installed in accordance with the safety description and risk assessment, see section 3.1. All security I/O is paired (redundant) and must be stored as two independent branches. Single failures should not cause loss of security function.

Safety I/O includes emergency stop and security stop. Urgent stop input is only used for emergency stop equipment, and safely stops input for various security -related protection equipment. Functional differences are shown in table below:

.. warning:: 
	- Do not connect the security signal to a PLC that does not have the correct and safe level. If this warning does not follow, it may cause serious damage or death because one of the security stop function may be covered. Security interface signals must be separated from normal I/O interface signals.
	- All I/O is a redundant -related I/O built (two independent channels). Two channels must be kept separately so that a single failure will not cause security function.
	- Before the robot is put into operation, it is necessary to verify the emergency stop safety function (the robot is powered on, press the emergency stop button, the robot is disconnected, the power is turned off, the rotating emergency stop button, the power is turned on, and the robot is re -power to enable it). Safety functions must be tested regularly.
	- Robot installation should comply with these specifications. Otherwise, it may lead to severe damage or death, because the safety stop function may be over.

The following sections are given some examples of how to use security I/O.

**Default safety configuration**
When the robot leaves the factory, it has the default configuration. It can be operated without any additional safety devices. Please refer to figure below.
