Basic information
---------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Node graph programming is programming software developed for robots. Its main functions and technical features are as follows:

- The connections between nodes better present the contextual logic of the program;
- Through operations such as creating nodes, connecting nodes, and editing node parameters, robot programming can be completed with just dragging operations and a small amount of parameter input;
- Helps to better visualize code and script complex and repetitive tasks faster;

For node programs, you need to right-click the mouse in a blank space to open the node program selection bar. Program instructions are mainly divided into logic instructions, motion instructions, force control instructions, control instructions, Modbus instructions, expansion axis and other instructions.

The input box above the node program selection bar allows fuzzy search to quickly locate the required node instructions.

The specific node program operation process is as follows:

- Click "Begin" to start the node and create the starting node programming location;
- Click on the selected program instruction node, the corresponding node diagram is displayed in the workspace, and the instruction parameters can be selected and entered in the drop-down box;
- The functions of the arrows on the right side of the command node: 1. A single arrow icon connects to the next node; 2. Multiple arrow icons, the first "Body" arrow icon connects to the content node, and the second "Completed" icon connects to the next node;
- Connect the "Begin" start node to the completed node program to end the node programming operation;

If/Else instruction
----------------------

Click the "If/Else" related command node to enter the node diagram editing interface. (This command requires a certain programming foundation. If you need help, please contact us)

“If/Else” command:

Laser recording instructions
----------------------------------

This command implements the function of taking out the starting point and end point of laser tracking and recording, so that the robot can automatically move to the starting point.
