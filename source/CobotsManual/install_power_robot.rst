Install the robot arm
------------------------

When the collaborative robot is installed on the mounting base, use a compliant number of bolts (strength not less than 8.8) to tighten and fix the robot on the mounting base;
it is recommended to use two compliant pin holes and pins on the mounting base for robot positioning to improve the installation accuracy of the robot and prevent the robot from moving due to collisions.
When the robot has high running precision requirements, be sure to add pins to position the robot.

.. important:: 
   It is recommended that the robot mounting base meet the following requirements to ensure that the robot is installed firmly and stably:
   
    (1)The robot mount needs to be strong enough and have sufficient load-bearing capacity. It should be able to carry at least 5 times the weight of the robot and at least 10 times the 1-axis torque.

    (2)The surface of the robot mounting seat should be flat to ensure close contact with the contact surface of the robot;

    (3)The robot mounting base should be strong enough, fixed firmly, and will not resonate with the robot;

    (4)When the robot and other parts move at the same time, the mounting base should be isolated from other moving parts, and should not be fixed together to avoid vibration interference during the movement;

    (5)If the robot is installed on a mobile platform or an external axis, the acceleration of the mobile platform or external axis should be as low as possible;

Connect the control box
-------------------------

This series of robots can be configured with three control boxes with different power inputs. For details on the control box power input, see the control box nameplate information.
The robot needs to be electrically grounded. The external wiring of the manipulator control system is connected using pluggable and quickly installed plugs.

A. 30-60VDC
B. 176-264VAC~50-60Hz
C. 100-240VAC~50-60HZ

.. note:: The AC input control box has two versions: narrow voltage and wide voltage. The control box wiring terminals and appearance are consistent, and cannot be distinguished by appearance alone. Please confirm by the control box nameplate and power on after confirmation.

The wiring panel of the collaborative robot is shown in the following figure:

The button box interface is the control port of the teach pendant by default, and the IP address is 192.168.58.2. Use a network cable to connect the button box interface and the computer. The computer IP address is set to 192.168.58.10 or the same network segment. Open the Google browser and enter 192.168.58.2 You can access the teach pendant page.
